UPDATED: . 15:36 EST, 25 October 2013 . The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it\\'s important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"\"The Milk Man,\"\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"\"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\"\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"\"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\"\" The organization \"\"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\"\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison.

Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd\\'s car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her\\xa0Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: \\'Our thoughts are with Rachel\\'s family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. \\'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. \\'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn\\'t long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. \\'We weren\\'t able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. \\'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it\\'s highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.\\' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: \\'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel\\'s family have lost her forever. \\'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they\\'re on the road. \\'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.\\' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road.

Sixty years prior, Ukraine\\'s breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won\\'t be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe\\'s 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea\\'s rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe\\'s leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin\\'s personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn\\'t like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US\\'s implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder\\'s lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the \\'money talks\\' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia\\'s peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It\\'s true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former\\'s GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe\\'s economy on the rebound and Russia\\'s one on the wane.\",\"Nina dos Santos says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions will hurt both sides .\\nTargeting Russia\\'s business community would be one way of sapping their support for President Putin, she says .\\nBut she says Europe would have a hard time keeping its factories going without power from the east .\"\\n0003ad6ef0c37534f80b55b4235108024b407f0b,\"Fleetwood are the only team still to have a 100% record in Sky Bet League One as a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe sent Graham Alexander’s men top of the table. The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxter’s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisley’s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time.

Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City\\'s Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient\\'s Lloyd James go up for a header .

Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Done’s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hill’s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson\\'s second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope\\'s opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywater’s last-minute own goal.

More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had. The former Los Angeles Lakers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs has helped Johnson - and millions of others - survive. Johnson, who became the face of HIV/Aids 22 years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities. Campaign: Magic Johnson has dedicated his life to raising awareness about HIV over the past 22 years . \\'We have to drive people to get tested, . because that\\'s the most important thing,\\' he told CBS News. \\'The stigma and fear . of knowing their status\\' is holding people back. Johnson admitted that when his team\\'s doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991 he was \\'devastated\\'. \\'At that time, people were really dying of Aids. I was just scared to death,\\' he said. The NBA star began treatment with Dr Michael Mellman and Dr David Ho, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival. But it was a meeting with Aids activist Elizabeth Glaser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness. Legend: NBA star Johnson, pictured here in 1985, was playing for the Lakers when he was told he had HIV . \\'Scared\\': Johnson announces he has HIV at a Los Angeles press conference in 1991. He and wife, Cookie, left, were devastated by the diagnosis . Johnson said that Glaser, whose HIV had developed to Aids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months\\' pregnant at the time, about living with the disease. \\'The one thing she did say was I was . going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was . become the face of the disease,\\' he said. \\'She felt it was really . important that I go public to help a lot of other people who were living . the same lifestyle who didn’t know they had HIV and needed to get . tested ... And she was absolutely right.\\' His wife, Cookie, who tested negative . along with their son, told the Huffington Post: \\'For us, it was super . hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying at . alarming rates. That was when people didn’t know anything about the . disease, so it was very frightening.\\' Awareness: This graph shows the estimated new HIV infections across subpopulations in the U.S. in 2010 . The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem\\'s Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities. Despite representing only 12 per cent . of the population, black Americans account for about 44 per cent of new . HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the . disease. Hispanic Americans are also more . likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers . for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new . infections each year. Overall, about 1.1 million Americans are living . with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five . unaware of their infection.

The remark was mainly greeted by cheers from Shrewsbury Town football fans travelling back from their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Yesterday Wolves fan Mr Downes, who was on his way home to Bayston Hill, Shropshire, with son Jack, 14, said: \\'There had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages, which threatened to boil over. The atmosphere was a bit hostile at times. \\'The announcement diluted the situation quite a bit and helped lighten the mood, to be honest.\\'But I thought at the time he might get into a bit of trouble for it.

Fletcher’s unveiling as the deadline day signing from Manchester United was almost eclipsed by the 21-year-old striker, who is acquiring the habit of talking himself into trouble. Ten years Berahino’s senior, Fletcher will be expected to mentor a player who told the world this week that he wanted to play for a bigger club. Tony Pulis has advised Saido Berahino to focus on his performances at West Brom . Darren Fletcher has signed for the baggies where he will be asked to provide a role model for young players . That is off the pitch. On it, the Scotland midfielder wants to prove he is good enough to cut the mustard in the Premier League after finding starts harder and harder to come by at Old Trafford. Head coach Tony Pulis believes that Fletcher, who has agreed a three-and-a-half year contract, will be captain of Albion one day. Having checked with Sir Alex Ferguson last year when he was Crystal Palace, Pulis did not need any more due diligence before moving in when a deal with West Ham collapsed. Pulis wants Fletcher to be his voice in the dressing room, especially when it comes to the younger players who may be led astray. Berahino has caught the eye with impressive performances at West Brom and suggested he could move on . Berahino’s latest outburst this week comes after he was found guilty of drink-driving and after he moodly refused to celebrate a hat-trick against Gateshead. ‘Things are not what they used to be,’ added Pulis. ‘The mentors for these young lads are just not there. These kids need guides and mentors so that the youngsters can respect them and take notice. ‘I think Fletch will be critical to that sort of stuff but give him time to settle in. As a character, having worked with him for a week, he is first class. He got through his illness with flying colours and I see him as a future captain of the club.’ As for Berahino, he will escape a fine. ‘He\\'s been in a naughty chair. That\\'s in my office,’ joked Pulis, although the underlying message was rather more serious. ‘We\\'ve had no phone calls. He needs to stop listening to all the kerfuffle.. This is a great football club with great players. And Saido has not become that yet. Pulis praised recent recruit Darren Fletcher and feels he could be an ideal role model for Berahino . ‘The question was whether would he like to play in a top four team and everyone wants that. His responsibility is to work for us until that happens. ‘I\\'ve spoken to him and his people. He has to do it rather than talk about it. That\\'s what good players do and then clubs will be interested. He\\'s done an interview but not for what he was supposed to be talking about.’ Fletcher has already been impressed by Berahino on the training ground but admitted: ‘The lads have gone straight into him. He has said something and he will learn from it. ‘He loves West Brom and wants to do well. He’s a young player who said something he shouldn’t and he probably regrets it. I’ve done that, all young players do that. ‘On first impressions he looks very sharp, a real goalscorer. He’s not shy!. Giving me orders straight away because he wants to score goals. He’s a nice kid welcoming, respectful and can be big influence for rest of season.’\",\"Tony Pulis believes Saido Berahino should look up to Darren Fletcher .\\nPulis insists Berahino has been listened to the wrong advice .\\nBerahino said he wants to move on to bigger things earlier in the week .\\nREAD: Berahino available for £20m after Liverpool target angers club .\\nCLICK HERE for all the latest West Brom news .\"\\n000940f2bb357ac04a236a232156d8b9b18d1667,\"Canberra, Australia (CNN) -- At first glance, it doesn\\'t look like much. Hidden behind an unmarked door, in a nondescript government office building in the Australian capital, it could be mistaken for a high school science classroom with work benches, slightly outdated computer monitors, and the odd microscope sitting in the corner. But what happens in this room is anything but amateur. We\\'re inside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau\\'s accident investigation lab, the place where the black boxes from Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 could be brought if and when they\\'re recovered from the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean. The place that may play a critical role in solving the mystery of what happened to the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Our guide today is Senior Transport Safety Investigator Neil Campbell. An engineer by trade, he\\'s been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades. Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenge of accident investigation, but there\\'s another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work. \"\"Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public -- that\\'s rewarding,\"\" he says. Just a handful of countries have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what\\'s inside a black box. And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here. \\'Object of interest\\' found . Retrieving the memory board . We start by the sink. Once the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder is retrieved from more than 4500 meters below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell. When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rinse the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart. Sometimes getting the data is simple. \"\"A lot of our work is with undamaged recorders and it\\'s very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,\"\" Campbell says, as he flips open a slot on the end of the recorder. But the process becomes much more technical if the recorders are damaged by fire or water. On the shelves of the lab\\'s main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions. Their metal casing is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior charred black. But even with these recorders, Campbell still has options to tackle what some might consider an impossible task. That\\'s because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU). Campbell unscrews a couple of bolts. Wearing gloves and grounded to an anti-static mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective insulation. In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand. This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live. In the case of the Boeing 777, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,000 parameters for up to 25 hours. Those include everything from altitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, even cabin temperature and pressure. Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second. The cockpit voice recorder captures four audio channels for a maximum of two hours before overwriting. One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: \"\"We could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,\"\" Campbell explains. If there\\'s water damage, Campbell says he will rinse the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven. That process can take a couple of days. Decoding the data . When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones. Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to decode each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when. To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audio analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor. For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, tragically ending in the death of both pilots on board. Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in helping the public understand an accident: \"\"There\\'s a satisfaction in working out what happened with the accident and the conclusions, and the closure that that brings.\"\" Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370 end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.

Ellie Zolfagharifard . Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north . You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian. Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured). The Gall-Peters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator . A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It\\'s said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface . Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia also isn\\'t as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to cones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar \\'Mercator\\' projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands .

Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head . For instance, The ‘Be On Guard!’ map was . created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine . and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor\\'s image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading \\'Whites\\' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Hinese Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of East and Western cultures. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map . Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the Americas, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific lapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre, and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes at a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and \\'less important\\' regions get ignored.

Google Maps claims that it is on a ‘never-ending quest for the perfect map’, but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn’t so sure. He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes. ‘No world map is, or can be, a definitive, transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world,’ he writes. ‘Each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users, as their understanding of the world changes.’ This map was used in 1782 by British diplomats negotiating an end to the American War of Independence in Paris. Richard Oswald, secretary to the delegation, annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the U.S./Canada border .\",\"The distortion is the result of the Mercator map which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world .\\nIt gives the right shapes of countries but at the cost of distorting sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north .\\nFor instance, north America looks larger, or at least as big, as Africa, and Greenland also looks of comparable size .\\nIn reality, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over .\\nMap suggests Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size .\\nThe biggest challenge for cartographers is that it is impossible to portray reality of spherical world on a flat map .\"\\n000c835555db62e319854d9f8912061cdca1893e,\"Two lawyers representing a woman who . claims to have had sex as a minor with prominent U.S. criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz have filed a counter-defamation . lawsuit against him.

It\\'s a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress. Now that corporate giants such as Pfizer, Walgreen, Medtronic and Mylan have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, Congress may finally act. These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won\\'t change the way they do business. Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company. If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain \"\"operational headquarters\"\" in Minneapolis, where the company is currently based. In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign. (Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion.) Walgreen, the nation\\'s largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland. Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U.S. tax bills. According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversions could provide an additional $19.5 billion in revenue over 10 years. Even among corporations that aren\\'t pursing inversions, shifting profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes is a huge problem. For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data. It\\'s clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that are exponentially larger than that country\\'s entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U.S. taxes. American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U.S. taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen. Corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders. Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries. A recent exposÃ© explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll Rand suddenly began reporting U.S. losses or very small profits each year after inverting to become a Bermuda corporation in 2001. This did not reflect any actual loss of U.S. customers or business. Rather, the corporation accomplished this by loaning $3 billion to its U.S. subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. Defenders of corporate inversions often argue the United States\\' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U.S. companies pay nowhere near that rate. Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here. But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true. The ultimate goal of much multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate. Reducing the nation\\'s corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U.S. taxes altogether. Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments. The drugs and devices made by Pfizer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreen, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs. They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible. Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U.S. economic system without contributing their fair share. But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign. The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here. There\\'s much more to be done to reform America\\'s tax code, but we can\\'t afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge. If Congress waits too long, there won\\'t be much of a corporate tax left to reform.\",\"U.S. corporations merge with foreign companies, move their headquarters .\\nMcIntyre: Such \"\"inversions\"\" enable firms to greatly lower their U.S. corporate tax bill .\\nHe says government can lose billions of tax revenue from such maneuvers .\\nMcIntyre: Congress should pass administration proposal to bar inversions .\"\\n001097a19e2c96de11276b3cce11566ccfed0030,\"For most people, it has become a travel essential.

In an angry tweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: \\'Oh @Lupita_Nyongo cln\\'t talk abt the bleaching creams white people (Companies) make cuz the white man pays her, they own her!!

The comment comes just a month after Miss Nyong\\'o mentioned Dencia - who has been accused of marketing her own brand of skin-bleaching cream called Whitenicious - in a speech about learning to value the color of her own skin. Scroll down for video . Butting heads: Nigerian and Cameroonian pop star Dencia has hit out at Lupita Nyong\\'o for her new contract with Lancome, accusing her of bowing to \\'white people companies\\' Fighting words: In a tweet directed at the 12 Years A Slave star, she wrote: \\'Oh @Lupita_Nyongo cln\\'t talk abt the bleaching creams white people (Companies) make cuz the white man pays her, they own her!! [sic]\\' The pop star is no stranger to . controversy; in a February interview with Ebony, she all but admitted . that Whitenicious is intended as a skin-lightener, not as a cure for . dark spots as it claims. \\'When . you take that picture and you put a picture of Dencia darker, this is . what you\\'re telling people - the product really works,\\' she said. \\'And guess what? People really want to buy it. It\\'s what it is. I don\\'t really care.\\' Given her defiant and hypocritical attitude, it\\'s no surprise the fiery singer was angered when Miss Nyong\\'o called her out in a speech at Essence\\'s Black Women in Hollywood event on February 27. Influential: In a recent speech, Miss Nyong\\'o read out loud a letter from a fan who said she decided not to buy Dencia\\'s skin-whitening cream Whitenicious because the actress had inspired her to love her own skin . On-screen: Miss Nyong\\'o won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 2013 film 12 Years A Slave . In her talk, the 30-year-old opened up about how conventional standards of beauty once affected her self-esteem, reading aloud a letter written to her by a young girl who viewed her as a role model. \\'Dear Lupita,\\' reads the letter. \\'I think you\\'re really lucky to be this black but yet this successful in Hollywood overnight. I was just about to buy Dencia\\'s Whitenicious cream to lighten my skin when you appeared on the world map and saved me.\\' \\'My heart bled a little when I read those words,\\' the actress said through tears, explaining how as a child, she, too, would pray that she\\'d one day wake up with lighter skin. Hypocritical: Dencia is no stranger to controversy; in a February interview with Ebony, she essentially admitted that Whitenicious is intended as a skin-lightener, not as a cure for dark spots as it claims . Perpetuating the problem: \\'When you take that picture and you put a picture of Dencia darker, this is what you\\'re telling people - the product really works,\\' she said. \\'And guess what? People really want to buy it\\' But while the actress saw the letter as a source of inspiration, Dencia took it as a personal attack. After her angry tweet at Miss Nyong\\'o, criticism poured in, with one person tweeting: \\'B**** lupita is the new face of Lancôme!! SHE WINS!! And you\\'re just TRASH [sic]\\'. In her response, Dencia said of the cosmetics company: \\'But they sell bleaching cream tho [sic]\\'. The pop star is likely referring to Lancome\\'s Blanc Expert range of cosmetics, which are actually advertised as \\'brighteners\\' that \\'regulate melanin production and awaken the luminosity of the skin\\'. And as far as Dencia\\'s claim that Lancome is a \\'white people company\\', a quick perusal of the website reveals that it has a number of concealers and foundations in darker skin tones.\",\"Dencia\\'s comment is hypocritical considering she recently courted controversy for marketing \\'dark spot remover\\' Whitenicious, which is frequently used as a skin-whitening cream .\"\\n00120f91cfcab17bac165f7a4719019a628a9db3,\"Britain and the West must brace themselves for more bloody atrocities before Islamist jihadists in Iraq\\xa0 are defeated, former top brass said\\xa0 last night. Retired commanders issued the chilling warning as they urged David Cameron to deploy more RAF warplanes to fight Islamic State fanatics. The ex-military chiefs also suggested stepping up Special Forces operations to ‘spoil the day’ of the fanatics, including British Muslims, who have swept across northern Iraq. Recruiters: British jihadis Reyaad Khan, Nasser Muthana and Abdul Raqib Amin are seen in an IS video released earlier this year. In the video, the trio encourage other Britons to join them . Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after gruesome images were published on the internet of a jihadist, with a British accent, murdering US journalist James Foley – claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes. As Mr Cameron condemned the ‘brutal and barbaric murder’, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said British troops could be sent to Baghdad to help train Iraqi soldiers to counter the growing threat. So far the UK has deployed an RAF\\xa0 Rivet Joint spy plane – a flying ‘listening post’ that picks up chatter made over mobile\\xa0 phones or radios – and six Tornado fighter jets fitted with state-of-the-art surveillance equipment that beam real-time images of targets\\xa0 to commanders. The aim is to gather vast amounts of crucial intelligence, including on militants’ manoeuvres, to support humanitarian efforts – but this could be used to support US bombers in strike missions to oust Islamic State. But Sir Michael, who served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1992 to 1997, warned the West must be prepared for jihadists taking retribution against other hostages as they were pounded by air strikes. Referring to Mr Foley’s murder, he said: ‘Being blunt, we sadly must expect more of this. We are dealing with fanatical, religious people who are long past the point of normal behaviour. They must be stopped.’ Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after a jihadist, with a British accent, murdered US journalist James Foley - claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes . He said the West should continue ‘evening the game up’ by supplying weapons, mortars and rockets to the Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers, who are fighting IS. ‘The jihadists have got their hands on artillery and weapons looted from the Iraqi army, which has given them a huge advantage. We should now be arming the Peshmerga to even up the playing field.’ Sending more RAF reconnaissance planes to the troubled region ‘will always be useful’ in building up an intelligence picture of the fanatics. Sir Michael said UK Special Forces on the ground could be deployed on top-secret operations to inflict huge damage on advancing extremists. ‘What I think they can do, if they are working closely with the Peshmerga, and I’m sure they are, is conduct missions which require the jihadists to mass [in an area] and the moment they mass, you have got a target. Then you can send in bombers and do things to them that really spoil their day.’ Air Commodore Lambert, who commanded Allied forces in enforcing a no-fly zone over northern Iraq in 1999, said he believed Britain should put on a greater show of military strength to deter the jihadists. In responce to the shocking footage of Foley\\'s beheading, which was titled \\'A Message to U.S.\\', British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond to vow Britain would \\'oppose ISIS with every breath in our body\\' He said: ‘If you want me to make one criticism, it’s this: the scale of the operation is probably too small. When we had the no-fly zone, there were 50 or 60 aircraft. Symbolically it quite often is useful to give messages to people that if you have a robust package then people take you more seriously that you know what is going on.’ He said deploying more RAF planes with reconnaissance equipment would allow ‘continuous coverage’ of the battlefield, compared to only a few hours that the RAF can do at present. Air Commodore Lambert added: ‘Obviously, if the threat increases then I would expect the UK and US to increase the number of assets there.’ One of the British jihadists in the region, Nasser Muthana, is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in Islamic State’s first professionally produced English-language propaganda video, which urged young Muslims in the West to join the terror group. Yesterday, Muthana mocked US efforts to defend Iraq’s Yazidi minority from genocide at the hands of IS militants, saying on Twitter they ‘can’t even protect their own citizens’. The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State’, said last month the UK government should be ‘afraid’ of his bomb-making skills. Muthana has been joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17. The brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young Britons who have travelled to Syria to join the rebels. British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. In the wake of US journalist James Foley’s brutal murder, they urged imams and mosques to do more to combat extremists – even if it means risking reprisals. Some imams have already made repeated appeals to radicalised youngsters not to join militants in the Middle East. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged Islamic communities to unite and tell the jihadists: ‘Not in our name.’ British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. Including Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford . But critics have unfavourably compared the recent appeals, via open letters and YouTube videos, with the thousands-strong marches organised to protest Israel’s military action against Gaza, or the publication of a\\xa0 cartoon of Mohammed in a Danish magazine. Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, said: ‘This grotesque murder characterises Muslims as barbaric savages. If this senseless killing doesn’t change people’s attitudes, what will? ‘In the UK the majority of the Muslim population are Sunni and the Sunni group has been remarkably silent about what is happening in Iraq. The time has now come for a mass outcry from mainstream Muslims, not only about this murder but also the persecution of the Iraqi Yazidis and Christians and the killing of other Muslims.’ Abu Muntasir, chief executive of the Muslim educational charity JIMAS, added that some religious leaders had been too slow to condemn the Islamic State terrorists due to fear of reprisals from extremists in Britain. He admitted: ‘In the past I have been more careful and shown restraint but enough is enough. ‘I’m prepared to take more risks to defy these evil people. I utterly condemn IS even if it puts me at personal risk, at danger of people coming to my home. I’m no longer prepared to be muted.’ He called on the Government to take tougher action against jihadists who travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight – despite having supported jihad himself in the past. The married father of 12 said he fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, but now believed fighters were driven by aggression, not religious devotion. He told the Daily Mail: ‘They seek guns and violence. It is not about jihad or religion, it is all pure escapism and adventure.’ Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of Manchester’s Ramadhan Foundation, said Britain would be at risk of terror attacks if radicalised fighters are allowed to return. He spoke out against IS, formerly known as ISIS, saying: ‘I utterly condemn the senseless and barbaric killing of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIS. ‘If this barbaric killing was not enough then the allegation that the beheading was carried out by a British citizen is deeply worrying for our nation.’ The Muslim Council of Britain released a statement saying: ‘Each day ISIS seeks to carry out an act more barbarous than the day before, craving the oxygen of publicity to give credibility to their heinous acts. ‘We condemn unreservedly their psychopathic violence, whether it is on minorities, on civilians or on fellow Muslims.’\",\"Ex-military chiefs suggested .\\nstepping up Special Forces operations to ‘spoil the day’ of fanatics, including British Muslims, in northern .\\nIraq .\\nAir Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, called for Britain to ramp .\\nup military options in Iraq .\\nThey spoke out after gruesome murderer of US journalist James Foley – apparently by a British jihadist, claiming it was in revenge for US .\\nair strikes .\"\\n00128f1ba30d5e9e0f17df83285a1bc2072e2f01,\"A woman has been charged with reckless manslaughter after her boyfriend\\'s mother tried to stop them fighting and suffered a fatal heart attack. Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other after they returned to their Bergen, New Jersey home following a party early on Monday. When Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, 45, tried to break them up, Hernandez Soriano assaulted the woman, according to the Bergen County Prosecutor. \\'During the assault, the victim apparently suffered a cardiac event which resulted in her death,\\' Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said in a\\xa0statement. Fight: Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, above, and her boyfriend Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, started punching and scratching each other at their home on Monday when his mother intervened . Injured: Martinez Rojas\\' booking shot shows the scratches on his face from the domestic dispute . A seven-year-old child also witnessed the fight, according to the prosecutor, but he did not reveal the relationship between the adults and the youngster. Police responded to a 911 call from the apartment just after 4am on Monday and when they arrived, they found Rojas-Jovel dead on a bedroom floor. \\'There were no obvious signs of trauma to the victim, however... the [couple] displayed signs of injury and appeared to have been involved in a domestic assault,\\' the prosecutor said. In their booking photos, both Hernandez Soriano and Martinez Rojas have scratches on their faces and necks. The pair were interviewed, as were the child and other residents. Scene: Soriano allegedly then assaulted the woman,\\xa0Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, and she suffered a cardiac arrest at the first-floor apartment at the house (pictured) and died before police arrived at the scene . The Bergen County Medical Examiner\\'s Office conducted an autopsy on Rojas-Jovel\\'s body, but results were pending toxicology tests, the prosecutor said. Hernandez Soriano was charged with manslaughter, endangering the welfare of a child, domestic violence simple assault and hindering apprehension, according to authorities. Molinelli said Hernandez Soriano also hid evidence - but would not detail what it was - which investigators later recovered in a search at the crime scene. She was held at the Bergen County Jail on $250,000 bail. Martinez Rojas was also charged with child endangerment and domestic violence simple assault and sent to the county jail on $75,000 bail.

The strike centered on a Syrian refugee camp located near the Syrian border between the towns of Baalbeck and Arsal in the Bekaa Valley, the National News Agency said. The Red Cross took the casualties to Universal Hospital in Baalbek. Saturday\\'s strike was not the first by the Syrian government, which has accused rebels of smuggling arms and supplies across the border. On March 18, two Syrian jets fired three rockets that hit empty buildings near Arsal. At the time, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman called the use of fighter jets to fire rockets into Lebanon a \"\"significant escalation.\"\" U.N. commissioner wants to probe into whether Syrian rebels executed soldiers . Also in March, the U.N. Security Council voiced \"\"grave concern over repeated incidents of cross-border fire which caused death and injury among the Lebanese population, incursions, abductions and arms trafficking across the Lebanese-Syrian border, as well as other border violations.\"\" The declaration followed a briefing by officials on how the conflict in Syria has spilled into Lebanon. More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a country of about 4 million people, according to a U.N. estimate. But the Lebanese government puts the total at more than 1 million. Whatever the true figure, there is no dispute that the influx has destabilized the area and heightened tensions. The attack comes as the Syrian conflict is mired in a third year of unrest, which started in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 and transformed more than 1 million others into refugees, according to the Red Cross.

The letter also noted that the Russian Government was refusing to recognise Mr Shilov\\'s dual nationality which in turn \\'seriously limits the ability of the Australian Government to provide consular assistance\\'. Mr Shilov had returned to Moscow three years before his arrest to assist his father with his spice trade business which supplied up to 20 per cent of the country\\'s poppy seed market at the time, the ABC reported. Poppy seeds are currently classified as narcotics by the Russian government. The Australian and Russian citizen, who has been detained without trial for two and a half years, has now been refused bail due to being considered a flight risk despite the Australian government assuring prosecutors that he would not be issued a passport . One of the charges laid against Shilov and his father by Russia\\'s Federal Drug Control Service is the importation of 47 tonnes of narcotics. The ABC reported that this shipment was made up entirely of poppy seeds and the Service had even admitted that only 0.001 percent of it could be extracted as narcotics.

The midfielder made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt  but has been targeted as one of the squad\\'s weaker links after failing to kick-on in the last year with any consistency. Everton manager Martinez was widely credited with improving Cleverley while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Trafford. VIDEO\\xa0Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Everton need to sign a few more players . On the move? Everton are interested in Manchester United\\'s much-criticised midfielder Tom Cleverley, with manager Roberto Martinez believing he can reinvigorate the England man . Previous experience: Martinez worked with Cleverley when he was manager of Wigan in 2010-11 . Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for the friendly against Roma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they have made the cut for his planned 22-man squad. The midfielder did not excel against Roma but like many of the United players is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Everton have already splashed out in excess of £35m this summer with Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Henen\\'s transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea\\'s Christian Atsu has hit stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8million. Bradford, Cleverley\\'s first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell on. Decision time: Louis van Gaal will trim his United squad to 22 after their tour of the United States . Statement of intent: Everton have already spent big on striker Romelu Lukaku this summer . VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad . Martinez may yet prefer to bring in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker but Cleverley\\'s situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from Everton. The concern at United would be that Martinez could find the key to re-invigorating Cleverley. Van Gaal though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players\\' performances. Deals for Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES . Frank Lampard\\'s arrival at Manchester City has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the Premier League champions\\' squad will be be made available. Sunderland are among the front runners pushing for a deal with Jack Rodwell while Valencia remain eager to take Bruno Zuculini on loan. Incoming: Frank Lampard\\'s arrival on loan at Manchester City could lead to the departure of other players . Good impression: Bruno Zuculini has looked good on Manchester City\\'s pre-season tour of America . Oriol Romeu has returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be loaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia want a defensive-minded midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Racing in Argentina but showed on the US tour why City have brought him into their squad. Valencia now hope to give him a season in La Liga where he can continue to improve. However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo La Coruna, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool\\'s defensive starlet Tiago Ilori. SOUTHAMPTON CHASING \\'MUSKETEER\\' SCHELOTTO . Southampton will hold further talks with Inter Milan over winger Ezequiel Schelotto on Tuesday. The 25-year-old should certainly give Ronald Koeman\\'s team a better cutting edge as his nickname is \\'El Mosquetero\\' or \\'The Musketeer\\' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier-swishing style on the wing. It is understood the nickname he actually prefers is \\'El Galgo\\' or \\'the Greyhound\\'. Negotiations: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is close to sealing the signing of Ezequiel Schelotto . Whatever name he wishes to use, Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is keen to push a deal forward. They have agreed terms on Dani Osvaldo and are discussing a loan for midfielder Saphir Taider also. Schelotto\\'s agent Bruno Carpeggiani said: \\'The situation with Southampton is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead.\\' Although Argentininian born and raised, Schelotto has been capped by Italy. He spent part of last season on loan at Parma. CANAS SWAPPING SWANSEA FOR ELCHE . Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain. Celta Vigo, who are playing a series of friendlies in England at the moment, have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Swansea manager Garry Monk left Canas out of the club’s pre-season tour to the US, leading his representatives to begin negotiations with Elche sporting director, Victor Orta. Return: Swansea\\'s Jose Canas is holding talks with Elche ahead of a possible return to Spain . Swansea remain on the trail of Almeria\\'s Ramon Azeez and have made enquiries about the Nigerian. Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya. Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000-a-week derailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures won\\'t be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea\\'s Fernando Torres who is on around £150,000. Manager Monk said: \\'Unless there\\'s a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it doesn\\'t matter. Even then, we\\'re in control - so all of that doesn\\'t matter, because it\\'s speculation - Wilfried\\'s our player.\\' Demands: Wolfsburg have shown an interest in Wilfried Bony, but his wages could be a stumbling block . NEWCASTLE SIGN FOREST DUO . Newcastle will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest on Monday and loan the pair back. Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility. The 23-year-old France midfielder has long been in Newcastle\\'s sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team. If one of those does not come along soon, the greater the Toon\\'s chances become. Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while . LIVERPOOL WRAP UP MORENO DEAL . Liverpool\\'s search for a left-back should be concluded soon as talks progress with Sevilla over the £16m transfer of Alberto Moreno. Sevilla have enquired about Sporting Lisbon\\'s 26-year-old Jefferson Nascimento as a potential short term replacement. LAZIO INTERESTED IN KABOUL . Lazio\\'s interest in Younes Kaboul should help Tottenham offset their pending outlay on Eric Dier and Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal. Tottenham have no plans to sell Jan Vertonghen as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for Michael Dawson. Kaboul, 28, is valued at around £6m by Tottenham although Lazio want to pay around £3m. They are also looking to offload Michael Ciani to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have no interest in Samuel Eto\\'o, who is looking more likely to return to Italy at this stage with West Ham also looking at younger options. On his way? Lazio are willing to pay Spurs £3m for Younes Kaboul . WEDNESDAY IMPRESSED BY KELHAR . Sheffield Wednesday have offered Slovenian trialist Dejan Kelhar a short-term contract. The 30-year-old defender, who has won six caps for his country and last played for Red Star Belgrade, has been training at Hillsborough and played in some of their pre-season friendlies. Manager Stuart Gray remains keen to sign a striker but Kelhar has also done enough to earn a deal. Gray said: \\'We are offering Dejan a short-term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us. Nothing has been finalised, he is mulling it over at the moment.\\' STOKE STOPPER BACHMANN HEADS TO WREXHAM ON LOAN .

Dragons\\' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has shocked Twitter followers by offering £50,000 to anyone who could identify - and break the arms of - a sinister tweeter who threatened to harm his daughter. The self-made millionaire became embroiled in a row yesterday afternoon after receiving a string of anonymous threats via the micro-blogging service. The messages threatened to \\'bring hurt and pain\\' to his family unless he handed over £35,000. Reward: Duncan Bennatyne sent out this message to his 372,000 followers . And although Mr Bannatyne later withdrew his threat, the entrepreneur said \\'I\\'d gladly do my time\\' to get revenge on the anonymous tweeter. The TV star received a series of tweets from someone calling himself Yuri Vasilyev, linking to a message threatening to harm Hollie Bannatyne, 25. He responded by posting: \\'I offer £25,000 reward for the capture of the coward who calls himself @YuriVasilyev_ Double if his arms are broken first\\'. Although this tweet was soon deleted, Mr Bannatyne posted another message saying: \\'OK £30,000 reward for info leading to his arrest\\'. The drama began yesterday, when he . received a message from the Twitter account @YuriVasilyev_ which linked . to a message about Holly. It read: \\'Dear Dragon. My name is . Yuri Vasilyev and I\\'m looking for a £35,000 investment to stop us . hurting your Hollie Bannatyne. We will bring hurt and pain into your . life. \\'We are watching her. She is very attractive. Want photos? Tweet using the hashtag £4money to confirm payment will be made.\\' Threatened: Duncan Bannatyne received sinister messages threatening his daughter Hollie, right .

We will stand . tall. You should have paid. £35,000 to stop it. Contact us to pay. We . are watching. Expect us. We are the men of Belarus.\\' Despite Vasilyev\\'s claim to be from Belarus, Mr Bannatyne has said that he believes him to be in Moscow.

Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows. The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states. That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000. Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years . The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago. As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state. Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land. Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom. In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said. New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population. New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.\\'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.\\'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found. The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children. The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago. Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000. Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago. \\'Empire State of Mind\\': An Amish man works in the field in Centerville, N.Y., a town with an established Amish community. While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German. Mr Kraybill said: \\'It\\'s remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America.\\' Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote. Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam. Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state\\'s Amish was published last year, said: \\'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they\\'re not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.\\' The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes. Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century. \\'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren\\'t any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,\\' she said. \\'They\\'re revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.\\' Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said. Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time. Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment. That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive. Pennsylvania had the nation\\'s largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.

Johnson, like Steven Gerrard, can start talking to foreign clubs in 31 days about joining them on a Bosman at the end of the season. But whereas Liverpool are in talks with their captain about a new deal, Johnson’s situation is drifting. The full back is clearly still committed to the cause — ending up with stitches in his head after diving in to score the winning goal — but has accepted that the end may be near. Liverpool\\'s Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1-0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield . Liverpool have not made any contact with him about extending his terms and Johnson, who has attracted interest from Roma, insists that he will not be pleading for a new deal. ‘I want to play for a club that wants me,’ said Johnson, who moved to Merseyside from Portsmouth for £17.5million in 2009. ‘I’ve seen some stuff that I have been offered half the money I am on. That’s not true. I haven’t been offered anything. ‘Time goes very quick. I’ve enjoyed my time here, the majority of the six years. There have been some good times, some bad times. But if I haven’t got a contract, I can’t stay. It does play on your mind but you have to be professional and do your best. I respect my team-mates more than anyone. Johnson celebrates scoring the vitally important winner with a thumbs up to the Anfield crowd late on . ‘I’m not going to go crawling to anybody. They know where I am and they know the situation. There were minor talks at the end of last season but nothing that I could accept or reject. ‘I don’t worry about things that I can’t control. All I can keep doing is my job. Whatever will unfold will unfold. It’s not my business to talk to other clubs. I’m concentrating on winning for Liverpool. I want to respect my contract and that’s what I will do.’ This has not been an easy season for Johnson. With Brendan Rodgers constantly chopping and changing his defence, his form has dipped and he has lost his place in the England squad. Johnson is congratulated by his Liverpool team-mates but needed treatment after taking a hit while scoring . That has led to him becoming a target for supporters’ frustrations. There were a number of growls on Saturday when he made a mistake in the third minute. Aside from that Johnson did little wrong and followed up bravely after Rickie Lambert’s effort struck the woodwork. ‘It hurts a lot less when the ball hits the net,’ said Johnson. ‘When Rickie headed it, I thought it was going to hit the bar, so I just kept going. We fought hard and I would have been very upset if we’d only drawn. We deserved to win.’ Rodgers sprinted down the touchline and celebrated the goal with supporters. Behind him, his assistants and Liverpool’s substitutes vaulted from their seats. Rodgers reflected: ‘There was a feeling of elation, probably a mixture of relief. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard looks on from the bench during the first half after being rested for the match . VIDEO Gerrard denies Rodgers rift . ‘We’ve got to make slow steps. The scrutiny was on us in a big game against a tough side but we came through it very well.’ Stoke will consider themselves unlucky. On another day Bojan Krkic would have scored rather than hitting the post. ‘There wasn’t any real momentum behind Liverpool’s play and we dealt with that quite easily,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes. ‘We let ourselves down. We had three or four defenders and (Johnson) reacted quicker than we did when it bounced off the bar.’ Liverpool manager Rodgers looks cheerful after his side secured a late win at Anfield against Stoke .\",\"Full back scored late winner as Liverpool beat Stoke 1-0 on Saturday .\\nVictory is the first for the Reds in the Premier League in over a month .\\nGlen Johnson\\'s contract runs out at Anfield this summer .\\nThe England international joined Liverpool from Portsmouth in 2009 .\"\\n001a6162391594e2a8607fba135bdfa154e57904,\"Would you believe that these breathtaking photos were seen through the lens of a kayaker\\'s GoPro camera?

A Florida woman said she was humiliated by local police as she accused them of hogtying her, parading her around topless and bashing some of her teeth out during her arrest last year. Ashleigh Davis, of Ocala, Florida, said she found herself on the wrong side of the law in April of last year at the Leesburg Bikefest after she and another woman were having an argument. When police asked her to leave, she reportedly refused, and was bound by her hands and feet by officers from the Leesburg Police Department and Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Humiliation: Ashleigh Davis can be seen laying topless in the middle of a holding cell, surrounded by several male officers . Damage: Davis said her teeth were cracked after one of the officers slammed her head into the floor . Speaking out: Davis says she deserved to be arrested, but not the brutality she claims to have suffered . The 32-year-old said that while she was being detained, her bikini top fell off, and officers whisked her away topless in front of onlookers. Davis told the Palm Beach Post: \\'[Officers] handcuffed my hands to my feet and then took a tie and tied it around, then carried me like a suitcase and threw me on the back of a golf cart.\\' Busted: Davis was given a green sweater for her booking photo . She told the paper that she suffered further shame at the Leesburg Police Department, as she laid nearly naked on the floor of the police station holding cell while a group of officers laughed at her. Davis said that the abuse didn’t stop there, as one of them allegedly smacked her face against the floor and chipped some of her teeth after she had bitten him. She told the Post: \\'I just remember him grabbing me from behind, my hair and [covered my mouth] and then I try to bite, and then they grabbed me by the back of my head and slammed my face down.\\' She admits that she probably deserved to be arrested, but that the officers she dealt with were way over the line. Davis was charged with two counts of aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and disorderly intoxication, and is serving probation in the case. She claimed that she had filed a complaint against the officer, days after her arrest. Her attorney, Stan Plappert, told WESH.com: \\'I think they should have sensitivity training. You would think that they would know that, \"\"hey, I have a topless woman or a nearly naked person. I need to do something to cover them up, to give them some dignity.\"\"\\' Davis added: \\'I don\\'t want this to happen again. I want people to be treated the way we’re supposed to be treated, and yes, I\\'m paying for what I did, and I want them to pay for what has happened to me.\\' Embarrassment: A surveillance video from the Leesburg Police Department shows Davis - who was topless - curled up on the floor .

A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners together have told how they won £50,000 backing from the Dragons\\' Den investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Hate It and Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Marmite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Dragons\\' Den to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren\\'t allowed to mention the name Marmite to the inquisitive Dragons. Scroll down for video . The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games - and persuaded the Dragons to invest . Dragons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Jones, second right, put up £50,000 for the board games . Mr McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Betty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and Esmee, 13, said: \\'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn\\'t mention Marmite on the show as they hadn\\'t yet agreed the design of the game. \\'They didn\\'t want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Dragons wouldn\\'t be interested.\\' Three Dragons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones demanding to know more. Mr McLuckie said: \\'We told them we couldn\\'t say the name but it was an iconic brand and a well-known supermarket brand. \\'Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Jones said \"\"Oh it\\'s Marmite\"\", and they agreed to invest. Jones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men\\'s games start-up, Pants On Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Hate It, the title of which is based on the idea that Marmite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up . The idea for Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge came to Mr McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Marmite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: \\'My wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. \\'It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.\\' He and Mr Mackenzie-Walker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and Mr McLuckie needed a new job. First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made-up facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Marmite. Mr McLuckie and his childhood friend Mr Mackenzie-Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games . Mr McLuckie and Mr Mackenzie-Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Kent to southern Spain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, WH Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. They appeared on Dragons\\' Den last night, and said their preconceptions about the Dragons were shattered after meeting them. \\'We thought we\\'d really like Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Kelly was a little bit rude and dismissive,\\' Mr McLuckie said. \\'Deborah Meaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hard-nosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful - so lovely. \\'We thought Peter Jones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard task-master, when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two. \\'They\\'re both great to work with and a really good laugh, too.\\'\",\"Richard McLuckie, 48, and Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, invented games .\\nWon permission from Marmite owner Unilever to use its name and image .\\nThen they went on investment TV show to ask for funding from the Dragons .\\nBut Unilever contract said entrepreneurs couldn\\'t mention name Marmite .\\nThree Dragons pulled out, but Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne agreed .\\nThey paid the men £50,000 for a 40 per cent stake in board game business .\"\\n001d9259673bd2ffb613217d19b98ca3563874ac,\"By .

The boss of Britain’s biggest insurance company will continue to receive his salary of £80,000 a month for the next year despite his humiliating resignation yesterday. Andrew Moss, who has quit as chief executive of Aviva after a shareholder revolt, will receive a golden goodbye worth around £1.75million in total. Last Thursday, 59 per cent of shareholder votes failed to back his gold-plated pay package worth up to £5.2million last year. It was the latest chapter in the growing backlash against boardroom greed, nicknamed the Shareholder Spring. Yesterday the 54-year-old chief executive said he ‘felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership’. But Mr Moss, who has also sparked public criticism for leaving his wife of 25 years and their four children for a junior married colleague, Deidre Galvin, in 2009, will not be leaving empty-handed. Walked: Aviva Group chief executive Andrew Moss, who is to step down with immediate effect . He will be paid his £960,000 ‘basic’ annual salary for the next year, equal to £80,000 a month, unless he finds another job. Mr Moss will also get a £300,000 bonus payment, a cash injection of £209,000 into his pension pot in five years’ time, deferred shares from a 2009 bonus, currently worth around £236,000, and a maximum of £45,000 in legal and other expenses. He has two pensions from Aviva: one worth around £530,000 and one worth around £2.75million, including the £209,000 payment. Mr Moss’s departure was announced on the eve of today’s Queen’s Speech, which is expected to fire the starting gun on a crackdown on boardroom excess and empower shareholders to veto any examples of corporate excess. Bounce: Shares in the UK\\'s largest insurer jumped five per cent following the announcement, suggesting investors approve of Mr Moss\\'s departure . Investor backing: The announcement was immediately followed by a spike in Aviva\\'s shares . At present, shareholders can vote . against pay deals, but their votes are not binding on the company and . directors can still receive the controversial pay and bonuses. The main . role of such votes is to embarrass bosses and damage the firm’s . reputation. The mood of investors has turned ugly recently, triggering . the departure of bosses at drugs company AstraZeneca and newspaper group . Trinity Mirror. Turmoil: Aviva\\'s St Helen\\'s skyscraper looms in the City, where three CEOs have quit amid recent shareholder anger . Yesterday, . the chief executive of William Hill, Ralph Topping, was the latest . victim, with nearly 50 per cent of the betting firm’s shareholders . voting against a £1.2million bonus and a 8.3 per cent pay rise. At its . annual meeting, one angry shareholder said: ‘Chief executives are dining . in the last chance saloon trying to take as much as they can as soon as . possible.’ Business . Secretary Vince Cable, who has heavily criticised boardroom excess, said . bosses are finally being ‘brought back to reality’. He welcomed the . ‘uprising’ by shareholders as ‘a healthy development’, and said he is . determined to stamp out ‘rewards for failure’. Since . Mr Moss became chief executive in July 2007, Aviva’s share price has . more than halved, decimating the nest eggs of thousands of its smaller . shareholders. Liberal Democrat . Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Shareholder votes must be binding, otherwise it . just like a jury who acquit a man of a murder charge but the judge still . gives him 20 years. What’s the point?’ Deborah . Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre campaign group, said: ‘The irony is . that Aviva was behind some of the recent pay revolts but, at the same . time, they were not looking after their own backyard. ‘This . is what makes Mr Moss’s payoff so intolerable. Aviva’s corporate . governance arm was lecturing others about pay and yet the company was . ignoring its own advice.’ Mr . Moss ceased to be chief executive ‘with immediate effect’ yesterday, but . he will not officially leave until the end of the month. Meanwhile, the average pay of bosses at Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to £3.65million, according to research published yesterday. The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the FTSE 100 index. On average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus several other lucrative perks, according to the research. But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services. The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time when inflation is 3.5 per cent. The report found that 8 per cent of workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen.\",\"Andrew Moss is third victim of recent discontent after departures at Trinity Mirror and AstraZeneca .\\nInvestors back the move as shares jump 5 per cent .\\nSmall savers and pension investors can have a voice on excessive executive pay.\\nThe Mail has teamed up with .\\nthe FairPensions campaign to offer a tool that allows you to send your views to .\\nyour pension fund or ISA provider.

They’re healthy, flavour-some and cheap enough to count as an affordable treat, perhaps on a skewer for a barbecue or daintily arranged for a dinner party starter. If we give even a moment’s thought about where they come from we probably imagine a sun-burnished fisherman skilfully tossing his nets out into the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean or South China Sea before hauling in his valuable catch. Nothing, I’m afraid, could be further from the truth. Intensively farmed: Jumbo tiger prawns are not so appealing after seeing the putrid factories where feed is processed for the prawn farms . As an environmental journalist, I’ve visited Thailand, the world’s leading exporter of farmed king prawns, many times to investigate the prawn trade, and what I discovered is so horrifying I will never eat another king prawn again. Every aspect of this trade is stomach churning: from the putrid factories that process the feed to the prawn farms that pollute the oceans. Welcome to the rotting, stinking and very dangerous world of the prawn trade, a world where industrial fishing boats exploit illegal slave labour to harvest the so-called ‘trash fish’ on which the prawns are fed and leave devastating environmental damage in their wake. I began my investigation aboard the trawlers that plunder the seas to provide the feed for the prawn farms along Thailand’s shoreline. While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Burma and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, even killed by unscrupulous skippers. These men suffer appalling treatment — some even dying on ship and having their bodies tossed casually overboard — just so we can taste king prawns in a lunchtime sandwich or Friday night curry. The damage to our oceans is also devastating. Watching a haul of trash fish being . pulled over the side of a Thai fishing boat is a heart-breaking sight: a . muddy mess of seaweed and rocks mixed with a vast variety of small or . juvenile sea creatures: crabs, starfish, sponges and small fish that . will not get the chance to grow any bigger. \\'Horrifying\\': Jim Wickens says that now he has seen Thailand\\'s king prawn trade first hand, he will never eat a one again . It was a sight I had to get used to as I worked undercover on these boats. My technique for getting aboard was a dangerous one. More than once I had to throw myself into the sea so that a passing trash fish boat was obliged to ‘rescue’ me. From my vantage point on deck, I saw how this grisly industry operates at first hand. Every few hours, a whistle would sound and a net would be hauled up from the depths, raised above the deck and, on a signal from the captain, the contents spilled out. Panicked marine creatures including sea snakes, baby octopus, sea horses, puffer fish and pretty pink crabs would scurry across the deck, only to be crushed underfoot and shovelled up into a heap before being thrown into the hold. These trawlermen employ one of the most environmentally damaging forms of commercial fishing to be found anywhere in the world: bottom trawling. This practice, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive. Entire tranches of marine life are effectively swept away and habitats and ecosystems that might have been there for centuries are destroyed. Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed and with them the futures of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom trawlers, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades. But no longer. Back on deck, the often enslaved crews, who are tricked into coming to Thailand by the false promise of generous wages, are woken by the deafening blare of an air horn mounted above their cramped sleeping quarters. Exhausted, but too frightened to disobey an order, they stumble to the deck to sort through the latest trash fish catch. It’s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side; everything else is shovelled into an already stinking hold. Many of these boats do have ice-controlled holds, but they are reserved for commercially valuable catches. The trash fish go straight into a filthy compartment where, with boats often at sea for days at a time, they soon start to rot. Damage: The Thai fishing trade leaves serious environmental damage in its wake and pollution in the ocean . By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable and there are regular reports of crewmen fainting and even dying after they’ve been sent into the holds to help with unloading, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes. These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trawler setting out. In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicides are common and murders not unknown. One crewman I spoke to had been shot at four times and had seen at least one crewmate killed. These desperate men are dying unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and family.Once the trawlers return to port, the commercially valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market. Putrid: The king prawns are fed on \\'trash fish\\' It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trucks arrive. Time and again, I witnessed the boats’ stinking holds being unloaded and their rotting cargo shovelled into ten-tonne dumper trucks. From here, it is a very smelly ride to an industrial processing plant, where the feed destined for prawn farms is produced. It is produced amid swarms of flies, temperatures that can approach 38C and a sweltering humidity of 100 per cent. The stench is foul. Load upon load of putrid fish and decaying marine creatures is poured into fetid storage containers. Every now and then you spot the eye of a beautiful coral fish or the glint of a long-dead starfish as the noxious mess is crushed and passed through a series of ovens until the final product — fish flour — is obtained. Transformed into pellets, this is then driven to the prawn farms that have all but destroyed Thailand’s mangrove forests. If you’d driven down the coast of the Gulf of Thailand 20 or 30 years ago you’d have seen mile after mile of these flooded forests, an incredible breeding ground for fish and a natural barrier that protected Thai farmers and their land from tsunamis. Today, however, most of these forests are gone. In their place is mile after mile of prawn ponds, their valuable contents protected by high fencing and security lighting. In these ponds, prawns are farmed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe. In Britain, we consume about 85,000 tonnes of prawns a year, two-thirds of which are warm-water prawns like those farmed in Thailand. The trade is worth £450\\u2009million in Britain alone. Prawns need brackish, slightly salty water, which is why former mangrove forests that have been cleared of their trees and cut off by sluices from the sea are ideal. But prawns also need feeding — a lot of feeding. Spend a day peering through one of those security fences and you’ll see men coming out every few hours to toss another bucket of ‘feed’ to the growing prawns. I watched from the side of one prawn pond as they prepared to harvest the fattened prawns. The sluices were opened and the prawns caught in a filter as the water drained out. They are beheaded and frozen in minutes but, in many cases, the filthy lagoon water, a grim cocktail of several months’ worth of excreta and food waste, is simply washed out into what’s left of the surrounding mangrove forests or straight out to sea. Concerned about Thailand: In Hugh\\'s Fish Fight, TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall went to examine farmed King Prawns, at Asia\\'s biggest prawn market near Bangkok . Thailand does have marine conservation laws designed to protect both its coastal waters and specially designated marine conservation reserves. But these are poorly policed and routinely ignored by ruthless commercial fishing fleets whose only concern is short-term profit at any cost. Meanwhile, thousands of miles from this marine destruction, we unthinkingly bite into a delicious skewer of tiger prawns, perhaps coated with garlic butter. But what are the alternatives to industrially produced prawns? Some certification schemes for so-called ‘responsibly produced’ prawns do exist, and marginal improvements to farming practices are beginning to take place. But in my research I have found that none of the certification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing. King prawns can also be produced organically. Naturally, this makes them very expensive for supermarket customers. But even organic prawn farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forest — even if trash fishing has been avoided. As consumers, however, we can look elsewhere. There are cold-water prawns from the North Atlantic, which currently account for about one-third of all prawns eaten in this country. Dublin Bay prawns from the Irish Sea\\xa0 — most of which are currently exported to France as langoustine — are another alternative. Neither, however, is currently available as cheaply or conveniently as Thailand’s tiger prawns. The only answer, I believe, is to stop eating warm-water king prawns altogether. I, for one, don’t want slave labour and the destruction of the ocean mixed in with my prawn cocktail.

Ten days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five-and-a-half hours of coverage. To think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympic Games in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans didn\\'t even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four-and-a-half years ago I was like most Americans and didn\\'t know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren\\'t you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I didn\\'t so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann . Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices . I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? How many households are aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the Games, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You couldn\\'t turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. So it is a weird feeling being back home. Four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four-and-a-half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 Games. Overcoming adversity . I will be honest, coming home from London isn\\'t what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the Games\\' most successful athlete; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. As I got on the plane to return to Minnesota I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. What I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the ups and the downs, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four-and-a-half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. We have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they don\\'t go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life doesn\\'t go according to a plan. We can map it out, we can plan it, we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. My life this past month had a plan of its own. It didn\\'t matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it didn\\'t matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close the plan I had envisioned wasn\\'t the plan that life had for me. Bubble . Over these past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was reclassified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. As I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do different next time. What can I change in my preparations over these next four years before the Rio 2016 Games? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. We were away from the real world in many ways. We didn\\'t think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was.

Dyson told CNN he wants the patent system in Europe radically overhauled. Over the last four decades, Dyson said, he has been affected enormously by people copying his ideas. Government leaders are continuously telling businesses that innovation drives the economy. But Dyson points to the red tape surrounding the patenting process as being a massive hurdle for businesses wanting to develop ideas. \"\"The problem with inventing: as soon as you file a patent they see what you are doing and they can see ways to get around it,\"\" said Dyson, who made his fortune inventing a bagless vacuum. The 64-year-old is an outspoken critic of Chinese counterfeiters, calling on governments to do more to protect intellectual property rights. Problems can arise because of the wording of the patents, Dyson said. \"\"There are no diagrams or drawings and often something hinges on the particular phrasing of the patent.\"\" According to Dyson, if it is obvious someone has copied another person\\'s ideas they should be dealt with without the parties going through a protracted legal battle. \"\"There shouldn\\'t be this endless rigmarole of \\'could this have been devised by one skilled in the art?\\'\"\" Because the current system involves many expenses due to varying jurisdictions throughout the continent, a Europe-wide patent is the answer, according to Dyson. \"\"You have to file in each country, you have to translate in each country, sue in each country, renews in each country -- it\\'s seen as a profit center for each country.\"\" Issues surrounding plagiarism are not limited to businesses, with consumers also feeling the impact of the high cost of producing and securing new inventions, Dyson said. Energy-saving and cost effective products and technology won\\'t be created because of the enormous upfront investment it takes to develop them, he said \"\"It\\'s anticompetitive to make copying easy.\"\" CNN\\'s Emily Smith contributed to this story.\",\"British innovator James Dyson has described patent laws across Europe as \"\"absolute madness\"\"\\nDyson says the current system involves many expenses due to varying jurisdictions throughout the continent .\\nHe says a Europe-wide patent is the answer .\"\\n00211175819295755ed12e89791b4d543442981a,\"(CNN) -- While the Tour de France ambles around the French countryside a dark shadow still lingers over the sport\\'s blue ribbon event. While the PR machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion, cycling\\'s attempt to lift the specter of Lance Armstrong still remains. A man who \\'won\\' the Tour de France on seven occasions brought the sport to its knees last January after finally admitting he doped following years of denying the allegations. Earlier this year, Armstrong revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone which is naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. His seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was doping -- while the U.S. Anti-Doping agency (USADA) accused Armstrong of running \"\"the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.\"\" Now, the Union Cycliste International (UCI), the sport\\'s governing body and its president Pat McQuaid are under pressure to revamp cycling\\'s entire image. But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck -- despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame. \"\"I\\'ll look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because the system wasn\\'t strong enough to beat him,\"\" McQuaid told CNN ahead of the start of the Tour. \"\"It wasn\\'t a question of authorities, because many authorities tried to catch him and weren\\'t able to, so I don\\'t blame the UCI. I don\\'t blame the AFLD (French anti-doping agency) or USADA or anyone else. \"\"The system wasn\\'t strong enough and they were using products that couldn\\'t be caught with the system. \"\"The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it\\'s not just Lance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it.\"\" Disillusioned . However McQuaid\\'s position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him. Cycling Ireland refused to back its home candidate for September\\'s UCI elections, while a recent management committee meeting in Bergen, Norway, was a fiery affair. A dossier compiled by private investigators on McQuaid was reportedly put forward to the committee with the Irishman blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting. The document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public, it represented another blow to McQuaid\\'s re-election hopes. While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong\\'s activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a hugely detrimental report from the USADA last October. The report raised question marks over whether the UCI had a role in covering up positive tests -- an allegation which McQuaid strenuously denies. When pushed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: \"\"No. Absolutely not.\"\" After being quizzed on how he could be sure, McQuaid added: \"\"Because we know, we\\'ve studied, we know what we\\'ve done and we know, we have looked into all of this even since. \"\"We have prepared, we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you\\'ve asked there are all answered in those files. \"\"I think he (Armstrong) was tested 10-15 times during the Tour de France. So we did all we could do. Those samples were sent away and they came back negative. \"\"The UCI wasn\\'t the only anti-doping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. \"\"I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn\\'t strong enough and it wasn\\'t at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better.\"\" But McQuaid is facing a challenge for the leadership from British cycling chief Brian Cookson, who has grown disillusioned with the Irishman\\'s tenure. It follows a catalog of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,000 donation from Armstrong in 2002 -- four years before McQuaid took up his role. The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraption which is used to analyze blood samples. It is a decision which McQuaid concedes should not have been made. \"\"I would say and we have said, we have admitted that in hindsight -- and of course hindsight is an exact science -- that it would have been better had we not accepted those,\"\" he said. \"\"But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to.\"\" Cookson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization. He has promised to create a completely new independent anti-doping unit, which would work alongside the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Cheats . McQuaid, who is aiming to secure a third term in office, remains philosophical about the future and the battle against doping. \"\"Nobody is silly enough to say that you\\'re 100% confident that the peleton is 100% clean,\"\" added the UCI president. \"\"That\\'s just not possible. It\\'s not going to be possible in any sport or in any parts of society, but certainly I think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers, not wanting to get involved in doping. \"\"And there\\'s evidence of many riders who come from strong teams, with strong anti-doping backgrounds all winning races and when they get across, you know, when they\\'re doing their press conferences, they are saying I\\'m an example of how you can win a race clean . \"\"I don\\'t think it\\'ll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats. \"\"There are people who look for a short-cut, who try to win by devious means or whatever. \"\"Whether it\\'s cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion, there are always going to be people like that in society and in sport .\"\" There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though -- a route which involves Armstrong. The opportunity to talk to the disgraced cyclist in a bid to improve doping control remains a possibility -- and McQuaid is refusing to rule out such a move. \"\"He certainly has more knowledge,\"\" he said of Armstrong. \"\"If he was prepared, in terms of coming to the UCI, not necessarily to me and explain in more detail or give us more assistance, give us more information and try to help us in planning the future on the fight against doping, we\\'d certainly be interested in speaking to him.\"\"\",\"Chris Froome is current leader of Tour de France .\\nFirst Tour since Lance Armstrong admitted doping last January .\\nUCI President Pat McQuaid insists his organization not to blame .\\nMcQuaid reveals his interest in speaking to Armstrong in bid to improve drug testing .\"\\n002124147bd10996f410d1a117ddf298018dbced,\"(CNN) -- After weeks of relative calm, clashes erupted between supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and Egyptian security forces and local residents in several areas in Cairo, state media outlets reported. Additonally, pro-Morsy and anti-Morsy protesters clashed in other Egyptian cities. Three people died and 23 were hurt in Zeitoun, in western Cairo, and one person was killed and 17 injured in Manial in central Cairo, according to state media. The violence came during a pro-Morsy march in Cairo. Since Morsy\\'s ouster and detention in July, his supporters have taken to the streets most Fridays. His supporters were unable to reach Tahrir Square and the presidential palace, according to state-run Al-Ahram. Morsy\\'s son: \\'Dad, you are the legitimate leader\\' Compared with violence in August that claimed hundreds of lives, the latest clashes appeared almost minor. On Friday, an anti-Morsy politician was stabbed in Cairo. It wasn\\'t clear whether the attack was tied to the protests. State media reported that Khaled Dawoud sustained stab wounds to his chest and hand. Dawoud resigned from the government in August in protest of the bloody crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The unrest came amid reports on state media concerning the fate of 170 imprisoned members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nile TV reported that this group, including a former governor, will be held for 15 more days for further investigation. It was not clear how long this group had been held or on what charges. Since July, arrests and violence have been commonplace. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations last week, Egypt\\'s interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring.

The children’s immunisation service, babyjabs.co.uk, claimed experts believe the vaccine \\'could be causing autism in up to 10% of . autistic children in the UK\\'. It also said: \\'Most experts now agree that the . large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but . also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.\\' The babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an \\'informed choice\\' about child vaccinations . It added that parental fears the jab caused autism . were \\'supported\\' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had . been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children. However, the ASA said both the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health have found no evidence of a causal link between MMR and autism. The ASA ruled: \\'Consumers were likely to infer from the claim, that the ‘real increase in the number of children with autism’ was not just down to increased diagnosis, but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase.\\' They added: \\'Because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case, and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion, we concluded that the claim was misleading.\\' BabyJabs Ltd denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded: \\'We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated\\'.

The Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved in a week since getting stuck in unusually thick ice on Christmas. The people on board say they are holding up fairly well. \"\"The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,\"\" said Alok Jha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360. \"\"There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other.\"\" Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes, Jha and Turney said. Turney said it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airlift, but rescuers must wait for conditions to improve. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter, which can transport 12 people each trip, will take the ship\\'s 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. \"\"People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,\"\" Turney told CNN. \"\"It\\'s New Year\\'s Eve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans.\"\" That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Jha said. And there may be good spirits -- both emotional and alcoholic, Jha and Turney said. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers said it wasn\\'t a bad place to be stuck. The scenery is beautiful. Penguins have been walking up to the ship and sniffing around, checking out their new neighbors. Close, but no rescue . The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D\\'Urville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the trapped vessel when it couldn\\'t get any closer  because of the ice. It returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority.\",\"Passengers preparing for New Year\\'s Eve festivities .\\nIt will take at least a day for the weather to improve .\\nHelicopter can pick up 12 passengers at a time .\\nBarge will ferry them from Chinese ship to Australian vessel .\"\\n00237a1d4477c976ee17d82d438e2650e0bff9a9,\"It is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child: breastfeeding.

Phenomenon: Maryellen Olson, 25, nurses her daughter Sequoia despite not giving birth . Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed \\'co-nursing\\', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn\\'t give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. \\'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,\\' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family\\'s home in Santa Cruz, California. \\'We both feel pretty amazed. \\'It\\'s amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.\\' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi\\'s due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started \\'pumping\\' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman\\'s body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called \\'More Milk Special Blend\\' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. \\'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,\\' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. \\'We get a lot of: \"\"Wow, that\\'s amazing!\"\" and \"\"I didn\\'t know that was possible!\"\"\\' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor\\'s sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. \\'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,\\' Heidi said. \\'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . \\'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.\\' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn\\'t have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn (\\'she really makes us work for it!\\'). \\'We don\\'t really have a set schedule or rotation,\\' Maryellen said. \\'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.\\' \\'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it\\'s not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.\\' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia\\'s cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: \\'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. \\'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she\\'s been out of the womb and I\\'m breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. \\'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. \\'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn\\'t have were I not breastfeeding.\\'\",\"Heidi and Maryellen Olson conceived first daughter using donor sperm .\\nHeidi gave birth to Sequoia on Nov 7, Maryellen wanted to breastfeed too .\\nMaryellen followed a program of birth control pills and a milk-enhancing drug for three months before the birth at home in Santa Cruz, California .\\nNow, both mothers nurse their daughter, claim it enhances their closeness .\"\\n0024a4404120db4544060c11050acaaae185f315,\"(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home. Ahlittia North had been missing since Saturday morning. Her mother awoke to find her gone from their apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harvey. Late Tuesday night, authorities charged Matthew Flugence, the nephew of Ahlittia\\'s stepfather, in the girl\\'s death. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff\\'s Office said Flugence, 20, often babysat for her. Flugence was arrested after he was spotted walking along a road in the area. He had a knife on him, Sheriff\\'s Col. John Fortunato said. Witnesses told authorities that Ahlittia was a friendly, outgoing child who always wanted to be first at the door when the doorbell rang, Normand said. After she was reported missing Saturday, investigators spent all day combing her neighborhood, looking in alleys, Dumpsters and boarded-up fourplexes. They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again. That\\'s when they found the girl\\'s body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said. Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday -- but they still don\\'t know when, he said. It\\'s possible Ahlittia\\'s body was placed there so the garbage trucks would take it away. Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings. Ahlittia suffered four stab wounds -- two to her neck, likely the fatal wounds, and two to the abdomen, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said. She also had bruises to the front and back of her head, shoulder, lower back, and lower extremities. Cvitanovich said were no obvious signs during an autopsy of sexual assault. Flugence\\'s brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said.

With divorce fast becoming the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days. But as these letters reveal, one smitten couple found a love so strong it was able to endure even while they were separated during World War II. Not only that, it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until they both died in 2011, he aged 96 and she aged 92, within just three days of one another. How time passes: Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year\\'s Day 1941 while Frederick . was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps and stayed married for . the next 70 years . But, as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life, in death it was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise. After Frederick and Elizabeth Noble had passed relatives discovered they had kept 250 love letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine\\'s cards from each other. Their grandson, Dr Andrew Rowland, has taken them along to the Antique Roadshow TV program. In one extract read on tonight\\'s show, Frederick writes: \\'You are the most wonderful, marvellous, precious, beloved, lovable, . adoring, adorable, charming, divine and loving sweetheart wife that has . ever lived. \\'Darling, come a little closer and let me whisper in . your darling ears, all these loving words, because they are meant for . you, my sweetheart.\\' The pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout World War II . The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine\\'s cards was stored in a tea chest . The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Wingate, County Durham. Speaking about the letters, Fiona Bruce, the show\\'s host, said: \\'Theirs was a real love story. What struck me about the . letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages. \\'They . reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love burned . even more brightly while they were forced apart by war.\\' Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year\\'s Day in 1941 while he was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps. He had volunteered for the Army in 1936 despite having been selected . as a professional footballer by Aston Villa and served in Afghanistan, . India, Burma, Ceylon and France. From these war-torn . countries he wrote the tear-jerking telegrams to his wife who was . nursing injured servicemen back home. After the war, . Elizabeth carried on her work as a nurse while Frederick became a miner . in the East Durham coalfield, before rising to the position of colliery overseer. During their long lives the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren and it was grandson who discovered the letters . Perhaps the most heart-wrenching messages were written when Frederick\\'s leave was cancelled. He says: \\'I\\'m very sorry my beloved, I can\\'t get home. That\\'s all I live for, . home and you. In another passage he adds: \\'We both feel the same when I have to return from leave. I have to take a . firm hold of myself or I would never come back. \\'I hate to see the back . of you as my bus or train pulls out because I know it will be weeks . before I set eyes on you again. It\\'s terrible when we have to part - too . awful for words.\\' Showing a touch of humour, Frederick writes again to compliment his wife\\'s skill in the kitchen: \\'Darling, no matter what you think, I still say that you are a good cook . - so let\\'s not have a small row. You know I wish that today I could . have sat down to one of your dinners.\\' Elizabeth\\'s communication is more limited, as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret. In the letters she did write she talks about the home front, rationing, and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the main road near their house. Only a small selection of letter were taken to Antiques Roadshow for filming and the family are keeping the rest secret while they decide what to do with them . While the letters reveal a lot about the couple\\'s marriage, the war and their incredible devotion to one another, only a small selection were taken along to the show\\'s filming in North Yorkshire. The rest are being kept a secret while the family, made up of the couple\\'s two daughters, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, decide what to do with them. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Dr Rowland revealed that towards the end of their lives the pair talked about not wanting to go on without each other. He said that the family were comforted in their sadness by the thought that, in the end, Elizabeth had only had to endure three days without her beloved other half.

But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all doors for me. I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn\\'t allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling white minority. So when the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three Test matches. I got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom. It was the \"\"flour bomb\"\" Test -- where a light aircraft flew over Auckland\\'s Eden Park before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and anti-apartheid leaflets -- where I began to realize that other countries didn\\'t like us. I didn\\'t understand why at the time, and it hurt a little. Later that day, I\\'ll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again. I was six at the time. They were right; I would next see these two teams play as a 17-year-old. First trip . My first trip to Cape Town\\'s Newlands Cricket Ground was to watch Western Province play a domestic match. It must have been my mom\\'s first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people. Confused, we sat down. A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed. I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was. We returned a couple of years later to watch my first \"\"Test\"\" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies. This time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment. I remember the hype and the excitement about this special day. I had seen the Windies in their warmup game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special. They had vicious fast bowlers and flamboyant batsmen. We got there early, along with thousands of others, just to watch the warmups. The excitement was tangible. I don\\'t remember much about the games -- I remember more about the players. They were heroes to us. Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islanders from far, far away on our shores. We used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground, hunting their prized autographs. And their accents -- just too cool. Didn\\'t see color . I know I didn\\'t see the color. I don\\'t think most kids did -- they were just cricketers. At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph. Somewhere there is footage of me congratulating Sylvester Clarke by patting his back. I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great bowler. While I had forgotten about it, listening to Franklyn Stephenson speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid\\'s Coke. He obliged and we all simply went crazy. I realize the significance of that event now. Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can? Perhaps our parents would have flipped out, but this wasn\\'t about color to us. Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were. Happy to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds. Branded a rebel . It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched \"\"Branded a rebel\"\" -- a CNN World Sport documentary which first screened last year. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. And while \"\"Branded a rebel\"\" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been titled \"\"Branded Heroes.\"\" That\\'s what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too. It\\'s all about what side of the line you were sitting, I guess. On their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living. The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions. I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them. Could we have done more? Did we look after them well enough after the fact? It\\'s a difficult one. These men didn\\'t deserve it, no matter what choices they made. Society can be cruel. Strangled by hatred . It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return. They were strangled by such hatred in their home countries, and yet I wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me. I got to see \"\"real\"\" international cricket played at the \"\"highest\"\" level. I got to meet new cricketing greats. I got to bowl like Clarke, Collis King and Colin Croft. I got to emulate David Murray\\'s great wicketkeeping skills on Clifton beach, field like Alvin Kallicharan and admire the patience and masterful batting of the great Lawrence Rowe. And something else -- they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field. Their smiles, I\\'ll never forget their smiles. Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches. They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans. What I didn\\'t understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside). They must have been scared -- really scared. I know I would have been. In the interview with Clive Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime. I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to South Africa. Courage . It\\'s not for me to judge, but those men were courageous. In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that. A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using \"\"white\"\" transport and stay in \"\"white\"\" areas. I remember asking my mom how that worked. She didn\\'t know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing. I was disappointed that more players didn\\'t take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary. I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murray\\'s thoughts, motives and reflective answers. There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason. As for those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep. Stephenson was just how I remember him. Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life. We got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Orange Free State. The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change of attitudes in South Africa. I don\\'t know if they changed us as a society but I\\'d like to thing so, even if it was an indescribably fractured and dysfunctional society. And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that \"\"The Cosby Show\"\" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. Heart bleeds . \"\"Branded a rebel\"\" showed balanced reporting. I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well. Great players like Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Clive Rice also effectively served life bans for being, well, South African, and the program understood that. I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nine-year-old devoid of political allegiances and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world\\'s best cricketers entertaining us on the world\\'s most beautiful stage. Ultimately, I\\'d also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.\",\"Sporting ban to campaign against apartheid in South Africa introduced in 1977 .\\n\"\"Rebel tours\"\" were highly controversial, unofficial, international matches .\\nTeam of West Indian cricket players visited South Africa in 1983 .\\nThey were shunned by society on their return home to the Caribbean .\"\\n0029837648b848c9cbde4c26744609e85f528a6c,\"Fears are growing that Britain\\'s jails are becoming a hotbed of extremism after it was revealed today that nearly half the inmates of one top security prison are Muslim.

The report, \"\"No News is Good News: Abuses Against Journalists by Palestinian Security Forces,\"\" criticizes Palestinian Authority forces in the West Bank and Hamas security forces in Gaza, saying they are abusing local journalists and limiting press freedom in the Palestinian territories. The 35-page report focuses on seven incidents in the West Bank and two in Gaza, saying they are \"\"cases in which security forces tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained journalists, confiscated their equipment and barred them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza.\"\" Human Rights Watch cites a report issued by the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedom that says there was a 45% increase in the number of physical attacks, arrests, confiscation of equipment and limitation of movement in the year 2010. \"\"We respect the Human Rights Watch report and other human rights organizations in what they do on the ground, and we have the readiness to investigate each case,\"\" said Maj. Gen. Adnan Dmeiri, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services. But, he said, \"\"Why don\\'t they consult us and ask us ... before publishing these reports?\"\" He said the security services will investigate and \"\"bring people to justice. The PA has no agenda to violate the rights of human beings and especially the rights of the journalists. We trust our justice system and the freedom of journalists is a priority of all things.\"\" Most of the abuses against journalists are connected to the rift between Fatah, which controls the West Bank\\'s Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, according to the report. Pro-Hamas journalists are targeted by the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and pro-Fatah journalists are targeted by the Hamas security in Gaza. The report stresses that the West Bank security forces have \"\"virtual impunity for serious human rights violations\"\" and states that the \"\"utter failure of the (Palestinian Authority) leadership to address the prevailing culture of impunity for such abuses suggests that they reflect government policy.\"\" \"\"We don\\'t accept the comparison between us and the militia in Gaza,\"\" Dmeiri said. He said his organization has no political agenda and \"\"we don\\'t hold and detain people on their background. We detain people if they have criminal or security threats or matters that threaten the internal security.\"\" Large sums are donated to the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank by the United States and the European Union. Human Rights Watch calls on the donor countries to condition their support to those security services by making sure that Palestinian Authority officials investigate and punish security personnel for their abuses. Attacks on International journalists in Gaza also have increased in the past couple of months. In March 2011, as journalists were covering a demonstration in Gaza calling for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, the offices of Reuters, CNN and NHK were raided by Hamas security forces. Efforts to get a response from Hamas officials were not immediately successful. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association released a statement expressing its \"\"grave concern\"\" that Hamas security forces \"\"brutally attacked photographers and cameramen, beating them, breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage.\"\" The organization called the developments the latest in a \"\"string of chilling attacks on reporters in Gaza.\"\" The United States and European Union have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Police watch over travelers at New York\\'s Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. \"\"The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,\"\" former Sen. Bob Graham said. He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. \"\"Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,\"\" he said.  Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack » . The U.S. government \"\"needs to move more aggressively to limit\"\" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. \"\"The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,\"\" he said. \"\"It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won\\'t be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,\"\" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons \"\"are more available,\"\" he said. \"\"Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms.\"\" \"\"There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,\"\" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. \"\"Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,\"\" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn, who said that the \"\"risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding.\"\" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. \"\"Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,\"\" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as \"\"the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism.\"\" While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, \"\"the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas\"\" in Pakistan. The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.

Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs, his Dynamic Teen Company recreates a school setting in unconventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. Peñaflorida knows firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Born into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. \"\"Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,\"\" he recalls. \"\"I will strive hard; I will do my best.\"\" In high school, Peñaflorida faced a new set of challenges. Gang activity was rampant; they terrorized the student body, vandalized the school and inducted members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. \"\"I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street.\"\" Peñaflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends \"\"got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,\"\" he says. He created the Dynamic Teen Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Peñaflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give kids the education he felt they deserved. \"\"They need education to be successful in life. It\\'s just giving them what others gave to me,\"\" he says. Today, children ranging from ages 2 to 14 flock to the pushcart every Saturday to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and English from Peñaflorida and his trained teen volunteers.  Watch Peñaflorida and his group in action with their push cart classroom » . \"\"Our volunteers serve as an inspiration to other children,\"\" he says. The group also runs a hygiene clinic, where children can get a bath and learn how to brush their teeth. Since 1997, an estimated 10,000 members have helped teach more than 1,500 children living in the slums. The organization supports its efforts by making and selling crafts and collecting items to recycle.  Take a look at the slums where Peñaflorida and his group spend their Saturdays » .

PUBLISHED: . 10:18 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 9 April 2013 . A man went berserk and stabbed his fiancée because of the stress of trying to win a £25,000 ‘dream wedding’ contest, a court heard yesterday. Lee Rowlands and Madelaine Moir, both 37, were one of five couples in the competition final who were attempting to win the prize by raising the most money for charity in a week. They were working 20 hours a day to try to raise the money when Rowlands suffered a ‘psychotic episode.’ He allegedly began hearing voices and attacked Miss Moir with two kitchen knives as she cowered on the floor. Strain: Lee Rowlands, right, and his fiancée Madelaine Moir, he he attacked with two kitchen knives during a psychotic episode while desperately trying to win a radio competition for a \\'Dream Wedding\\' She was wounded on her breast, arm, fingers and knee and he ran into the street believing he had killed her, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Yesterday Rowlands was jailed for 28 months after admitting unlawful wounding. He will be released in a few weeks because he has been in custody for 13 months and would have been automatically freed at the halfway point of his sentence. Miss Moir is said to have stood by him and they still hope to get married. The couple had been together for two years before the attack on March 14 last year. They entered the competition run by Sheffield-based independent radio station Hallam FM in the hope of winning the £25,000 wedding package, including a honeymoon in Sri Lanka, venue hire, dress, flowers and photographer. In her application Miss Moir wrote: ‘We wish we had met years ago, we love each other and want to shout it to the world.’ Stand by your man: Miss Moir arrives at Sheffield Crown Court to see Rowlands sentenced. The pair still hope to marry one day . Alison Dorrell, prosecuting, said the couple had a happy relationship and Rowlands had become the father figure to the divorcee’s two children. But Miss Moir had noticed her partner’s heart beating irregularly and he began to speak about hearing voices. He also threatened to jump out of the window and harm himself. During the 25-minute ‘episode’ Rowlands attacked his fiancée with two kitchen knives at their home in Armthorpe, Doncaster. He then ran outside in his boxer shorts ‘saying he had killed her’. Rowlands was found by police sobbing in the street. Miss Dorrell said: ‘He was making no sense at all.’ Miss Moir needed hospital treatment and later had surgery on a finger injury. She said later she didn’t recognise the man who attacked her.\\xa0 ‘He wasn’t himself and she was of the view that he didn’t want to hurt her and he wasn’t thinking rationally,’ said Miss Dorrell. Miss Moir wrote in her victim statement: ‘We never argued. This is why I can’t say what happened. It is as if somebody else had taken over his body.’ The court heard she had helped turn Rowlands’ life around. He had served time in jail, and they entered the wedding contest because he was desperate to prove himself. Richard Barradell, defending, said the couple aimed to raise £2,000 each a day to win the wedding prize. However, it became clear ‘things were getting to Lee Rowlands’. Mr Barradell said ‘something snapped’ and Rowlands had a ‘psychotic mental breakdown of rapid onset’. ‘He is desperately sorry for what he did. He can’t explain it.’ Judge Robert Moore said Rowlands had been receiving mental health treatment and his release in a few weeks under licence would enable him to continue his rehabilitation.

The two pilots \"\"became distracted by a conversation\"\" about the airline\\'s new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said. The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots\\' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U.S. military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft. According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency. The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is \"\"likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button. Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller.\"\" The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. \"\"These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,\"\" the NTSB said. Further, the captain\\'s absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot\\'s actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. \"\"The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,\"\" the board said. \"\"Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188.\"\" The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane\\'s primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain \"\"looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,\"\" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters. The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots\\' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. \"\"Neither sector controller\\'s relief briefing included information that communication had not been established\"\" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. \"\"Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,\"\" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector\\'s controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as \"\"emergency\"\" or \"\"mayday\"\" that may have helped capture the pilots\\' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt. Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was \"\"completely unacceptable\"\" and \"\"put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy.\"\" But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines\\' internal investigation is continuing.\",\"First officer didn\\'t completely load radio frequency, NTSB says .\\nHe and pilot then were distracted by discussion, personal computers, NTSB says .\\nNTSB also blames air traffic controllers for not realizing problem earlier .\"\\n002c715ea1428373cc432c9508d4a48d2e6069f4,\"Four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of a young student used \\'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful force\\' against him, a court has heard. Brazilian student Roberto Curti, 21, died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, after a chase and violent struggle with police in Sydney\\'s CBD in which he was tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on. Policemen Scott James Edmondson and Daniel David Barling have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm while Chin Aun Lim and Damian John Ralph face the charge of assault.

Brazilian student Roberto Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on . A court heard on Monday that the four police officers involved used\\xa0\\'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful force\\' against Mr Curti . On the opening day of a four-week hearing, prosecutor Cate Dodds on Monday said Mr Curti became increasingly afraid and erratic after taking the drug LSD with two friends on the night of March 17, 2012. By the early hours of the morning, Mr Curti was seen running around the city before going to a convenience store and stealing two packets of Tim Tams. After a triple zero call, police initially described the biscuit theft over the radio as an armed robbery involving two men. Policemen Scott James Edmondson (left) and Daniel David Barling (right) pictured earlier this month have been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mr Curti was eventually spotted by police who began chasing him along Pitt Street at about 6am. He was dressed in blue jeans and had no shirt and no shoes on. When police caught him, Ms Dodds said Lim successfully deployed his Taser at Mr Curti causing him to fall to the ground. What happened next, she said was \\'unnecessary, excessive and unlawful\\'. As Mr Curti lay handcuffed on the ground, surrounded by cops, Lim discharged his Taser for a second time. Chin Aun Lim (left) and Damian John Ralph (right) face the charge of assault . Meanwhile Barling, the court heard, used the Taser\\'s \\'drive-stun mode\\' on five separate occasions, while Edmondson used his twice. Mr Curti was also hit with capsicum spray by Ralph, Ms Dodds said. The cause of Mr Curti\\'s death is undetermined but he was unable to be resuscitated at the scene. The hearing continues on Tuesday. Earlier this month the four police officers were seeking to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them. In a hearing in the first week of November, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were now making an application to stay the proceedings against them. All four have pleaded not guilty and earlier this month were trying to halt all criminal proceedings against them . Barrister Bret Walker SC told the court, the prosecution case against the four police officer including Scott Edmondson (pictured) was \\'rooted in an eradicable error\\' The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti\\'s death, Mr Walker said. During the interviews, officers were \\'compelled\\' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them. Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became \\'inextricably entangled\\' in the ensuing investigation of them. This meant the prosecution case was \\'rooted in an eradicable error\\', he said. The hearing commenced on Monday and will run for the next four weeks. \\xa0Chin Aun Lim is pictured here a fortnight ago . But Crown Advocate Natalie Adams SC, appearing on behalf of the attorney-general, said only three pages of Lim\\'s interview had ever been handed to the DPP. If the admissibility of the interviews was in question, Ms Adams said there should be an application for that evidence to be excluded. \\'This is not a basis for a stay,\\' she said, adding that should be a \\'last resort\\'. Magistrate Mark Buscombe will hand down his decision on the permanent stay application by the four police officers on November 11.

John Hall . Scam: Patricia Glancy conned five couples who were getting married at Wentworth Golf Club . A wedding planner who stole £11,000 from couples marrying at one of Britain\\'s top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer . Patricia Glancy, 36, conned five couples into leaving blank cheques with Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account. Although she admitted stealing the money, Glancy was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Thelma Harte on holiday to New York, as well as on large donations to cancer charities. Glancy stole a total of £10,787.50 pounds between March 1 and June 6 last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses. The scheme was was finally detected when a bride emailed the club about her wedding preparations - only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left. Judge Peter Moss, sitting at Guildford Crown Court today sentenced Glancy to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the weddings of all couples that fell victim to the scam. During the trial Judge Moss was handed \\'proof\\' Glancy used to the cash to pay for a trip to New York for a friend, Thelma Harte, who was dying of cancer. Ms Harte is believed to have died before the scam was detected. Glancy also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf club’s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer hospices. \\'Wentworth Golf Club picked up, as you would expect of a reputable organisation, the costs to fulfill their obligations that fell through because of your fraud. You risked damaging their reputation because of your actions,\\' said Judge Moss. \\'You fully admitted this matter and I bear in mind you are 36 years of age and of good character. Suspended sentence: Patricia Glancy (pictured) was spared jail after it emerged she spent the stolen money taking a dying friend on holiday to New York, as well as making large donations to cancer charities . Money: Guildford Crown Court heard that Wentworth Golf Club (pictured) had honoured all the weddings for couples that found themselves conned out of thousands of pounds by Glancy . \\'Your best friend was dying of cancer . and you wanted to provide trips for her to New York and you also . mentioned you had given donations to charity events for two particular . hospices, Judge Moss added. \\'You certainly had . bought equipment from the professional shop - at a discount no doubt - . with some of the proceeds you had taken from your customers. \\'I saw evidence you had been engaged in those charity events. It attracted, for you personally, a considerable amount of praise and admiration from family and friends. That may well have been the motivation for you.\\' Glancy, from Ascot in Berkshire, admitted five counts of fraud by false representation at an earlier court appearance. Judge Moss said her crimes deserved custodial punishment but decided to suspend her six-month prison sentence for 18 months. The judge told Glancy that she would immediately serve the six-month term if she committed any further crimes in the next 18 months. Scene: Patricia Glancy conned five couples into leaving blank cheques at the world-famous Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey (pictured). She would then deposit the cheques into her own bank account . He also ordered that she paid £350 pounds costs. Prosecutor Trina Little had earlier told the judge how Glancy worked at Wentworth Golf Club, near Virginia Water, Surrey, from January 16, 2012 to May 31 last year as club’s events sales manager. She said: \\'She was tasked to arrange wedding receptions for people getting married at the club and liaised with the parties in doing so.\\' \\'Miss Glancy was asking for deposits. On four of the counts the parties paid by cheques. They left them blank and she said she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp.\\' \\'She completed her name and details.\\' One payment was made by bank transfer - but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, Glancy gave her own account number, the prosecutor said. Lisa Patel and Mo Maan had just under £1,940 pounds diverted without their knowledge. Lauren Sandford’s father wrote a cheque for £2,650 pounds as a deposit for his daughter’s wedding to Gary Kearton. Home: Guildford Crown Court heard Patricia Glancy had now repaid all the money she had stolen. Above, Glancy\\'s home in Ascot, Berkshire . A further cheque for an almost identical sum for Daniella Field and Matt Joy’s reception failed to land in the club’s account. Then £1,239 pounds for Nikki Hitchmore and Hooverney Martinez’s big day was taken, before Nadine Maraj and Shiraz Sharif had just over £2,300 pounds vanish into Glancy’s account. The frauds, which were carried out between March 1 and June 6, 2013, were exposed by an investigation launched after Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email, only for a message to bounce back saying she had left the club. Wentworth honoured the payments to make sure the weddings went ahead as planned. Glancy’s defence counsel Robert Spencer-Bernard told the judge that his client was \\'genuinely remorseful\\' and had paid back the full amount to Wentworth. The judge had deferred Glancy’s sentencing hearing last month to give her time to prove she had spent the money on charitable causes, and to repay the cash.\",\"Patricia Glancy, 36, conned couples out of money at Wentworth Golf Club .\\nShe admitted five counts of fraud, with the stolen money totaling £10,787 .\\nGlancy was today spared jail after proving how the spent stolen money .\\nShe had donated large sums to charity and took dying friend to New York .\"\\n002cceec34994ff6ff91f6232054e5f71b9eb4b5,\"The secret to staying slim could be in saliva. Researchers have found that a gene that makes a carb-busting compound has a large influence on weight. Nicknamed the Atkins Gene in some quarters after the popular diet, its official scientific nickname is AMY1. The gene makes an enzyme that is found in saliva and begins the breakdown and digestion of starchy foods like chips, crisps and rice. Carbohydrates: Researchers have found that a gene that makes an enzyme found in saliva begins the breakdown of starchy food and can have a large influence on weight . The study showed that people who had more copies of the gene made more of the enzyme and were more likely to be slim. Although we normally think of genes as coming in pairs, some people will only have one copy of a gene.\\xa0 Others will have two, three or even more. In the case of the AMY1 gene, it possible to have up to 20 copies.

The researchers, from King’s College London and Imperial College London, said that future dietary advice may have to be tailored to a person’s digestive system. Professor Tim Spector, the study’s joint lead author, said: ‘These findings are very exciting. ‘The next step is to find out more about the activity of this digestive enzyme and whether this might prove a useful marker or target for the treatment of obesity. ‘In the future, a simple blood or saliva test might be used to measure levels of key enzymes such as amylase in the body and therefore shape dietary advice for both overweight and underweight people. ‘Treatments are a long way away but this is an important step in realising that all of us digest and metabolise food differently – and we can move away from ‘one-size fits all diets’ to more personalised approaches.\\'\",\"AMY1 gene makes a carb-busting compound and can influence weight .\\nGene makes enzyme in saliva that begins the breakdown of starchy food .\\nIt has been nicknamed the Atkins Gene after the popular diet .\\nStudy finds that those with more copies of the gene are likely to be slim .\"\\n0031f262451b4b335dfda3aca9b533d244244e1e,\"By .

Historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen World War One soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in France in 1914. The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20. It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009. Now, his great-nephew Eric Saunders, 61, . from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with . one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative. Eric Saunders has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, belongs to his great uncle . Private Frederick Thompson (left and right, with his wife) was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20. Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, in 2009 . And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on. The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death . Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier\\'s remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Mr Saunders said: \\'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. \\'I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. \\'I have grandchildren that age myself, and I can’t even begin to imagine what those soldier’s poor mothers went through. \\'I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. \\'I didn’t really know anything about my mother’s side of the family. We were both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time. The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields. The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium . In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving. The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place. \\'I was very keen to give a DNA sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes. \\'I’ve . been told it may take several months to come back with a result, but I . hope I can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve. \\'I’ve said that I would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men, even if it turns out not to be my uncle’s remains.

Tragic: David Lee Collins, 19, was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub in the popular resort of Ayia Napa last November - the photo on the right is thought to be last image taken of him before his death . The three-judge bench said that Collins had confronted Osman and his friends after being punched by an unidentified nightclub patron, raising a clenched fist at the group and telling them \\'Are you bad men?\\' - a phrase which the court said is interpreted in Britain as a challenge to a fight. The court said that it was a group of friends with Collins - all of whom were soldiers - that started the fight. The court also took into account that there was no premeditation on 19-year-old Osman\\'s part since he didn\\'t previously know the victim, had fully cooperated with investigators and had apologised to the victim\\'s family. Sentenced: Mohammed Abdulkadir Osman, 20, originally from Somalia but believed to have been living in London, admitted manslaughter at a court hearing in Larnaca on April 22 and returned for sentencin . David Collins\\' mother Lisa Minott, arrived at\\xa0 the court in Larnaca, Cypru\\xa0 clutching a large handbag with a painted portrait of her son .

Charges against two other teenagers, who were both 17 at the time of the stabbing, were dropped. Mr Collins, from the 2nd Battalion, . Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died from a \\'ruptured heart caused by a . sharp instrument\\', according to a post-mortem. Killed while off-duty: Tributes have been paid to Mr Collins, second left, on Twitter and a Facebook page has been set up in his memory . Party: Mr Collins (fourth from right in black and red cap) was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub . Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub . He was stationed at the British Army base at Dhekelia but was due to fly to Afghanistan the day before he died and his battalion\\'s mission was delayed. Mr Collins\\' mother Lisa Minott and her sister - along with members of his regiment - were in court to hear the sentencing. MoD spokeswoman .

After the rape and murder of Danish tour guide Louise Jensen by British servicemen in 1994, the centre of Ayia Napa - a clubbing resort with a reputation for sex, drugs and violence - was declared off limits to soldiers by military top brass on the island. About 3,000 British military personnel are stationed in Cyprus at bases retained after the former British colony gained independence in 1960. In 2008, nine British soldiers went on trial accused of trashing a pub and beating up its owner during a mass bar brawl on the island.

Conceived in 1970 by Richard Branson, the company started out with a magazine four years before that, which Branson began while still at school. The next move was into the music industry, setting up Virgin as a music retailer and then branching out into music production. The first recording was the 1973 smash \"\"Tubular Bells,\"\" by Mike Oldfield. The Virgin Group has gone on to grow very succesful businesses in sectors ranging from mobile telephony, to transportation, travel, financial services, leisure, music, holidays, publishing and retailing. Virgin has created more than 200 branded companies worldwide, employing approximately 50,000 people, in 29 countries. Revenues around the world in 2006 exceeded £10 billion ($20 billion). In 2002, the combined sales of the different Virgin holding companies exceeded £4 billion ($8 billion). The equity of Virgin Music Group -- record labels, music publishing and recording studios -- was sold to THORN EMI in 1992 in a $1 billion deal.

Spherical fossils in China dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet\\'s earliest animals.The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion . Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils. Each fossil measures around 0.03 inches (0.7mm) across and originated from what could have been a marine environment at the time. \\'This opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the Earth in a very visible way,\\' said Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geobiology in the Virginia Tech College of Science. Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils . The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 540 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. \\'Fossils similar to these have been interpreted as bacteria, single-cell eukaryotes, algae, and transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges, sea anemones, or bilaterally symmetrical animals. This paper lets us put aside some of those interpretations.\\' By cutting the rocks into extremely thin slicers, the scientists were able to shine a light through the fossils to see the formation inside, according to a report in LiveScience. Professor Xiao found patterns in the fossils that suggests cell-to-cell adhesion and programmed cell death - qualities found in the cell of animals and plants. The fossils could represent the shift between single-celled life and multicellular animals, Professor Xiao said. Professor Xiao is now hoping to find more Megasphaera, including fossils of the adult creatures that may have created the embryos. \\'We will have to be open-minded in terms of what can be expected,\\' Professor Xiao told Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience. \\'There are extinct animals or even offshoots of the lineages leading to animals that could be rather different from what we know as animals living today.\\'\",\"Called Megasphaera, the fossils were found in rock in southern China .\\nThey are 60 million years older than date skeletal animals appeared .\\nBut the cells are too complex to be belong to bacteria, the study claims .\\nThey may represent shift between single-cell life and multicellular animals .\"\\n0033829349643e2964a8c3ce5fd997116ce43f7c,\"By .

A motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket. Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal\\'s car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally . When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal\\'s car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He said: \\'There is even paint on my front bumper where they\\'ve caught it reaching under to paint the lines. \\'There were no lines there when I parked. I can\\'t believe they\\'ve done it.\\' The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal\\'s front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal\\'s window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when. He said: \\'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking. \\'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn\\'t.\\' A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car. David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: \\'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error. \\'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers. \\'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.\\'\",They even sprayed paint on his Ford Fiesta in calamitous giveaway .\\n003477088ee670dee05e53d0b24ebfcf9a692cec,\"One of the country’s biggest rail terminals will be ‘effectively closed’ today because of over-running engineering works. There will be no trains in or out of King’s Cross in London due to delays to Network Rail works north of the station. The disruption comes on one of the busiest travel days of the year, as thousands of people try to return home after visiting family for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Services in and out of London Kings Cross station have been cancelled today, it has been announced . Frustration: Travellers at the London station, one of the busiest in the country, where services are cancelled . The disruptions at the station, which is managed by Network Rail, will affect those planning to travel on East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern services. East Coast Trains made the announcement on its website yesterday evening, where it advised passengers to delay their travel if possible. It also said that a revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Customers have been advised they need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train because of the overrun works in the Holloway area. A reduced service to and from the station will go ahead as planned on Sunday, with trains  leaving up to 20 minutes earlier than normal from King\\'s Cross. Last night Passenger Focus, the independent watchdog, described the delays as ‘frustrating’. East Coast made the announcement on their website and apologised for disruption on what is \\'an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break\\' They follow years of complaints from passengers that Britain’s railways effectively ‘shut down’ over the Christmas and New Year holiday. The chaos is heightened by the fact that the West Coast Main Line is already closed for engineering works over the Christmas period. The route is shut between London Euston and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire until Monday, and also closed between Stafford and Crewe until Sunday. Last night travellers vented their frustration with the King’s Cross closure on social media, saying Network Rail had ‘explaining to do’. The station is the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, which provides services to major cities including Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh. East Coast spokesman, Paul Emberley, said: \\'Network Rail has apologised to passengers for the inevitable delays to their travel plans on Saturday as a result of the overrunning engineering works. \\'East Coast is particularly sorry too for the inconvenience to its customers as a result, on what we know is an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break. Sources said that the station would effectively be closed  due to delays to works north of the station . \\'For customers intending to start or finish their journey at King\\'s Cross, consideration should be given to deferring travel plans to either Sunday or Monday. \\'We\\'re working hard over the holiday period to make the necessary adjustments to our timetable as a consequence, and to provide as much information as we can.\\' National Rail said on its website that services to and from King\\'s Cross would be \\'significantly disrupted\\' tomorrow. It said there will be no trains before 10am tomorrow and over the weekend, many trains will start or terminate at Doncaster, Peterborough, Stevenage or Finsbury Park. Meanwhile, First Hull Trains will run two trains in each direction each day to and from London St Pancras International instead of London Kings Cross. Great Northern are diverting some trains to and from Moorgate between 8.30am and 7.30pm. It said:  \\'A revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Please check our website regularly for updates. \\'Passengers travelling to and from central London may use London Underground services between Finsbury Park and central London. Customers will need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train, according to East Coast Trains . \\'Buses will run between London Kings Cross and Finsbury Park when there is no train or London Underground service.\\' The rail company said that the work was part of a £200 million Christmas investment programme. It is one of 300 projects being undertaken over the holidays across 2,000 sites up and down the country by some 11,000 railway engineers. A spokesman said: \\'What has happened is really regrettable and unfortunate, but it is a small part of a massive amount of engineering investment taking place over Christmas.\\' The spokesman added that 4.5 million passengers use the railways on average every day, compared with two million a day over the holidays. The company confirmed the disruption at around 8.30pm on its Twitter page - hours after it was first announced by East Coast Trains, which said: \\'No service between Kings Cross & Finsbury Park tom due to track work in the Holloway area which has taken longer then expected. Apologies.\\' Hundreds were forced to take to the roads yesterday after rail services were virtually non-existent today . A reduced service will also operate to and from the terminal on Sunday as planned, with journeys possibly being re-timed or taking longer than expected, according to Network Rail. David Sidebottom, passenger director at the independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: \\'Investment in maintenance and improvement is necessary, and we passengers understand that. \\'But overrunning works that disrupt already-limited festive travel are frustrating. \\'Our research is clear: passengers want to be kept on the train wherever possible, they want to know before buying a ticket if part of the journey will be by bus, and they want plenty of staff on hand to signpost where to go and what to do. \\'We will be looking to see that operators and Network Rail are doing all in their power to alert passengers, to help them make alternative arrangements and to make it easy for them to claim refunds or compensation.\\' Several frustrated passengers have taken to Twitter to vent their anger. Liam Gladdy said: \\'Something must have gone very, very wrong for @networkrail at Kings Cross if they\\'re looking at overrunning by 2 days for 2 days work.\\' While Amelie Soleil wrote: \\'Ahhh what\\'s that? All trains are cancelled coming though Kings Cross tomorrow. Brilliant. Nice to see that £200 train ticket was worth it.\\' Emily Clifton said: \\'Trains all cancelled from King\\'s Cross tomorrow literally what am i supposed to do,\\' while another user said \\'The UK are so unprepared. Today it\\'s just like \\'Oh, by the way, we\\'re closing King\\'s Cross for a few days.\\' It comes after a day of travel disruption on the railways as every single major artery in Britain was closed on Boxing Day. Trains between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines - and the Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia lines remained shut yesterday. The near-non-existent Boxing Day service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the shutdown dating back to at least 2007. Labour and Tories have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service, which affects football fans, families without cars and shop workers in the Boxing Day sales. Apart from airport shuttles and Eurostar, only Chiltern, Scotrail, Southeastern and Southern ran trains yesterday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open during the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where lines are closed.’\",\"East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern lines hit .\\nPlanned works in Holloway area of London were not completed in time .\\nCustomers advised to  start and finish journey at Finsbury Park instead .\\nThousands expected to make post-Christmas return journey on Saturday .\\nEast Coast Trains apologised for cancellation on a \\'very busy travel day\\'\\nNational Rail said  services would be \\'significantly disrupted\\' tomorrow .\"\\n00359f516cdf8b1800c7102711bd9aa400d1c749,\"Veteran actor Victor Spinetti, who starred in all three Beatles films, has died at the age of 82.

There is something for everyone in Ghana, ranging from nature trails and UNESCO World Heritage sites to bustling markets, tranquil beaches and vibrant nightlife. Wildlife . There are 15 national parks and reserves across the country. A must see is Kakum National Park, in the central region. The area is covered with stunning tropical rainforest and rare animals, and a long series of hanging bridges known as the Canopy Walkway. Not for the faint hearted, the walkway is located at the forest canopy level, and is secured by a series of nets and wires for safety. The walkway provides tourists with a spectacular vantage point of the beautiful surroundings. Another great place to visit is Ghana\\'s largest wildlife refuge, Mole National Park. The park is located in northwest Ghana, and the park\\'s entrance is reached through the nearby town of Larabanga. It is home to over 93 mammal species, with large mammals including elephants, hippos, buffalo, and warthogs. The park is considered a primary African preserve for numerous antelope species; olive baboons, black-and-white colobus monkeys and the green vervet are among the monkey species resident there. Slender-snouted and dwarf crocodiles are among the 33 known species of reptiles that call this breathtaking park home. Read more: 26 of the most stunning spots in Africa . Heritage . The country became a major economic hub with the emergence of the slave trade, and several slave castles erected by the Europeans in 15th century remain standing. Built by the Portuguese in 1482, Elmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has become a pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors from around the world -- in particular African-Americans and Caribbean people seeking to connect with their heritage. The town of Elmina surrounding the castle is a vibrant, robust fishing community with an incredible amount of energy and color. Accra .

Visitors can buy a wide variety of items such as hand-crafted wooden sculptures and masks, paintings, native fabric, spices, handmade jewelry and much more. Kumasi is also home to the National Cultural Centre, the Menhya Palace and Lake Bosumtri. The lake is the only natural lake in Ghana and the area is peaceful and tranquil. Like Accra, Kumasi also has a vibrant nightlife with restaurants and entertainment to suit all tastes. When it comes to accomodation, Ghana offers everything from homestays to five-star accommodation. Major international chains include Golden Tulip, Novotel, Best Western and Movenpic. The Marriot, Sheraton and Hilton Hotels are set to open later in 2013.\",\"Ghana is a country rich in history, culture and natural beauty .\\nMole National Park is home to more than 93 species of mammal .\\nElmina Castle is the oldest remaining slave castle in Africa .\\nOsu, in Accra, offers visitors a vibrant nightlife .\"\\n00377ab9d3caafb18464c47d0535ae2781aeef15,\"(CNN) -- Two separate incidents at coal mines in Southwest China over the weekend left at least three miners dead and 42 trapped, state media reported. Days of heavy rain caused a mine at Niupeng in Guizhou province to flood on Saturday morning; while \"\"rain-saturated earth on the surface collapsed into a shaft\"\" at another pit in Guangxi around noon the same day, killing three miners, Xinhua said. The report added that more than 1,000 police, firemen, and paramilitary personnel joined the mission to rescue the trapped workers at Niupeng. By Monday the water level at the mine had dropped but was still 40 meters (131ft) higher than where 23 of the miners are believed trapped, according to reports from China National Radio. Local authorities said the heavy rain may have caused a previously dry river to rise, while possibly increasing the water level in underground rivers around the mines. According to Xinhua, the Niupeng mine\\'s investors have already been detained by the police. At Guangxi, high concentrations of gas prevented workers from using machines to dig out another 19 trapped miners trapped at a depth of 390 meters (1,200ft), China Daily said. 50 other miners were reported to have escaped the cave-in. Continued rain on Sunday further complicated the rescue effort, it added. \"\"The rescue team is only equipped with shovels and rail track cars\"\", Meng Qingguan, head of the Heshan Work Safety Bureau, told CCTV on Saturday. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, as very few of the mines follow the government\\'s safety regulations. According to the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS), almost 2,500 miners were killed in mine accidents in 2010. However, the head of SACMS, Zhao Tiechui, said Tuesday that the number of miners dead or missing from accidents had decreased by 35% from last year, with just 807 dead so far in 2011.

U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia\\'s coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes. One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages. Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here. Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd\\'s Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \"\"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\"\" when traveling through the area. -- CNN\\'s Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.\",\"Passengers will fly to Dubai to continue their journey .\\nHapag-Lloyd: Involves 246 passengers, most of crew aboard MS Columbus .\\nPrompted by travel warning for the area issued by German Foreign Ministry .\\nUnited States, UK advise those traveling near Somali coast to use extreme caution .\"\\n003ae6f81b90eae41831361deae8a5da3705dc4f,\"Louis van Gaal has welcomed a public message of support from Sir Alex Ferguson but admitted it has put more pressure on him to succeed at Manchester United.

A senior judge told the state-run China Daily that all detainees in the city under the \"\"laojiao\"\" or RTL system would be released by the end of the year. \"\"The police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system, which has become outdated,\"\" Yu Mingyong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People\\'s Court, was quoted as saying. \"\"Many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after ... their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years.\"\" Guangzhou still has about 100 people in labor camps, he said. Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but said there were few RTL camps and detainees in cities. It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province. Despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and Marxist indoctrination -- HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers. How it started . Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet \"\"gulags\"\" -- a place where \"\"counter-revolutionaries\"\" and \"\"class enemies\"\" could be detained without trial. Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was overhauled in the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping released prisoners accused of political and religious offenses. According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Re-education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,000 people were held in 350 re-education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008. The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,000 people. Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing. Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, \"\"subversives,\"\" such as Falun Gong practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial. In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Yuming Yong, said the city\\'s administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system. \"\"Judicial reform of RTL has been a priority this year,\"\" Yong told the Nanfang Daily. \"\"Guangzhou has stopped approval of re-education through labor (cases) further highlighting the protection of citizens\\' personal liberties.\"\" An administrative tribunal official Xiao Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be \"\"digested out\"\" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments. In January this year, the central government in Beijing strongly hinted that it would begin scrapping the system although Guangzhou\\'s announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken. Cosmetic changes . While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reform-oriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system. Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic re-branding of an otherwise repressive system. \"\"Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that\\'s their identity,\"\" Bequelin said. \"\"Unfortunately, this \\'reform\\' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from \\'Re-education Through Labor\\' to \\'Coercive Detoxification Center.\\'\"\" He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the RTL detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to HRW â€” are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in Beijing. \"\"It\\'s not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 RTL detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system. Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, \\'Custody and Education,\\' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,\"\" Bequelin said. These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions. \"\"In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal. And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,\"\" he added. He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Beijing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage. \"\"As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end re-education through labor, not to shift detainees to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and offenders below the age of 18,\"\" Bequelin said. Backlash over exposed cases . Two high-profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash, forcing the government to address the thorny issue of RTL. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for \"\"disrupting social order\"\" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11-year-old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for re-tweeting Weibo posts that were deemed seditious. While even Guangdong\\'s progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was \"\"not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs,\"\" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL. \"\"The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,\"\" read one Xinhua editorial. \"\"It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.\"\" Jie Chen contributed to this report .\",\"China\\'s third city Guangzhou announces first steps in unbolting \\'Re-education Through Labor\\' system .\\nSystem was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet \\'gulags\\'\\nIt provides for detention without trial for petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers .\\nHuman Rights Watch says the changes to the system, however, are only cosmetic .\"\\n003c99210ffb08a21ff004000cac7e2efcfd48de,\"By .

Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC’s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his ‘shame’ at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some £5million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank\\'s Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a ‘classic case of tax avoidance’. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was ‘no tax advantage’ and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank’s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: ‘There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.’ Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC’s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: ‘We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. ‘It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn’t normally how large organisations can run.’ HSBC has been criticised as being ‘too big to manage’ after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver’s watch. It was fined £1.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined £400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.’ ‘I would expect to die abroad,’ he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was ‘astonished’ that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. ‘Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,’ he said. ‘But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. ‘There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.’ Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a ‘source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC’. Despite this he received a £7.6million pay package last year, including a £1.3million bonus. This was a drop from his £8million package in 2013 – his bonus was cut by £500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to £12.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from £2.6billion to £2.4billion.\",\"Stuart Gulliver\\'s bonuses allegedly paid via Panama-registered company .\\nMoney put in Swiss account until 2003, leaked documents reportedly show .\\nMr Gulliver said this was the only way to hide earnings from colleagues .\\nClaims without Panama business others in bank could search for earnings .\\nHe said: \\'It was to enable confidentiality.

David Williams . They were intended to be ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing some of their most notorious crimes. The interviews, recorded for a history project, were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned. But after a fierce legal battle, the secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a police station in Antrim yesterday. Former friends: Gerry Adams (left) is pictured in Long Kesh prison with Brendan \\'Darkie\\' Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA\\'s Belfast Brigade. Hughes said Jean McConville was killed on Adams\\' orders . Murdered: At least two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader (right) to the murder of Jean McConville (left), the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, executed and secretly buried in December 1972 . At least . two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the . murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, . executed and secretly buried in December 1972. The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing. Adams . has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the . IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland . suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the . streets, questioned, shot and buried. But . the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a . detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the . 65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement. Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville\\'s death or the IRA policy of \\'The Disappeared\\' Grieving: Jean McConville\\'s family members carry flowers and a photo of their mother following her death . They . include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger . striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s . Belfast Brigade. Hughes, . who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There . was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said. ‘I . did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was . being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or . disappeared as they called them now. ‘The . special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, . you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I . had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular . squad.’ Search: Irish police excavate the beach in Louth, Ireland, where the body of Jean McConville was found in 2003 . Removing her body: The mother of ten\\'s body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth . Funeral: The family of McConville carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered . The . other damning account is that of Dolours Price, the first woman to . become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the . terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973. Price, . who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small . select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast . Brigade. The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the . Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal . investigations to weed out informers’. ‘The . hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared,’ Price said. ‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply . told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or . whatever. Past: A younger Adams (centre) attends the funeral of an IRA member who was killed while planting a bomb . Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday . \\'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them . across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember . some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’ Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman. ‘I know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children. Damning: Dolours Price, the first woman to become a member of an IRA active service unit, was the other operative to give a damning account . ‘I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary to a place of safety. ‘It was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to disappear her, thank God. ‘You don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’ Like Hughes, Price provided her personal account of her time in the IRA to be part of the Boston College history project and in subsequent interviews. Researchers at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed over relating to the McConville case. The wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s. Bell’s interviews, if accepted as admissible evidence, could be used against Adams because Bell is still alive. Bell was charged in March with aiding and abetting in the murder of McConville, which he denies.

Rush Limbaugh has apologised for calling a college student a \\'slut\\' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers\\' contraception. The controversial radio host\\'s comments, which included a suggestion that Sandra Fluke should make a sex tape, caused a row which saw him abandoned by advertisers and even drew in Barack Obama. But today he acknowledged that he \\'chose the wrong words\\' while trying to \\'illustrate the absurd with absurdity\\', and insisted: \\'I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.\\' Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a \\'slut\\' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls . for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually . promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have . forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their . employees. But instead he dialed up the . rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke should film herself having sex and . then claiming that she \\'had boyfriends lined up around the block\\'. However, after three companies pulled . their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to . express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday . afternoon, three days after his initial remarks. His apology read: \\'For over 20 years, . I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five . days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of . the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.\\' He went on to argue that \\'personal . sexual recreational activities\\' should not enter the public sphere, as . this undermines notions of \\'personal responsibility and accountability\\'. Mr Limbaugh concluded: \\'In my . monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what . is going on in anyone\\'s bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that . should reach a Presidential level. \\'My choice of words was not the best, . and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I . sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.\\' Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show . Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were \\'immediately suspending\\' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the \\'inflammatory comments\\' On his radio show yesterday, the . 61-year-old defended his comments\\xa0 and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke . \\'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my . day\\'. He said: \\'She\\'s . having so much sex that she\\'s going broke, she says... You\\'re worried . here that I\\'m just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the . truth.\\' \\'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch\\' Rush Limbaugh . On Friday three . advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show . after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious . institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said . in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever . happens. Mattress retailers Sleep Train . and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all . bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on . the show. ‘We don\\'t condone negative comments . directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you . for your concern and input.’ \\'Recent . comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,\\' a Sleep Number . spokesman said. \\'So we made decision to immediately suspend all . advertising on that program.\\' A QuickenLoans spokesman . said: \\'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable . feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush . Limbaugh.\\' Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will . \\'re-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it . will look into ‘the matter of \\'network buys’. Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college . Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying . woman should get the pill for medical reasons. And he went even further on his next show, saying: \\'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.\\' Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh\\'s remarks \\'reprehensible\\' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of \\'inappropriate personal attacks\\' Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC\\'s Today show on Friday that she was \\'stunned and outraged\\' by the comments . Mr Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh\\'s remarks \\'reprehensible\\' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of \\'inappropriate personal attacks\\'. \\'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,\\' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President \\'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women\\'. \\'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways . is bad enough,\\' a White House spokesman said. \\'It is worse when . it\\'s directed at a private citizen simply expressing her . views.\\' More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has . also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with . Rick Santorum calling his comments \\'absurd\\'. When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: \\'I\\'ll just say this, which is, it\\'s not the language I would have used.\\' Mr Limbaugh . said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke\\'s comments on birth . control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes . her a prostitute. She wants . to be paid to have sex. ‘She\\'s having so much sex she can\\'t afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’ Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left \\'very upset\\' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh. \\'My reaction was the reaction . a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these . types of names,\\' she told MSNBC. \\'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.\\' Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama\\'s mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn\\'t allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama\\'s mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. \\'She\\'s having so much sex she can\\'t . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being -- WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE -- cause your heart to constrict with terror? Well, friends, we hear you. Having just returned from the liquor- (and other liquid-) soaked climes of Austin and SXSW, we\\'re pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3% of all \"\"Cool Things\"\" present at that havoc-wrecked fest. Basically, all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex, and, mysteriously, Train (thanks Monstro!) and that the most-flogged apps at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead. Enter: Sonar, Highlight and Banjo, a new wave of social apps designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you -- without requiring that you look up from your smartphone (my Precious...)! These apps were, by far, among the most buzzed-about at SXSW, with Highlight taking the coveted top spot (according to Mashable). Charts and graphs aside, it remains to be seen whether Highlight will be able to assume the many-storied role of \"\"The Next Twitter\"\" or \"\"The Next Foursquare,\"\" both of which gained traction at Nerd Spring Break. That\\'s partly because it and these other apps run in the background on your phone, with always-on GPS that drain your battery. But it\\'s mostly because the word \"\"creepy\"\" keeps coming up in the same sentence when people talk about this new cadre of mobile apps. Still, don\\'t let that silly little adjective scare you off! Because if you don\\'t download these apps, you\\'ll be missing out! And you don\\'t want that, do you? Do you?! We didn\\'t think so. That\\'s why we\\'ve provided a handy scale for you below, which should be instrumental in finding the level of \"\"Creepy\"\" you FOMO-sufferers are comfortable with. Kind of creepy: Sonar . So you\\'re chilling at your apartment, staring -- moleperson-like -- into the glowing half light of your computer screen. All your Sims have finally drowned in the swimming pool, and you\\'re getting tired of thumbs-downing dubstep tracks on Turntable.fm, so you fire up Sonar. Sonar is a pretty simple app for Android (in beta) and iOS that shows you two things: Who is chilling at hot spots near you, and who -- in general -- in your vicinity you might be interested in meeting. When you launch the app, you\\'ll be asked to connect to your social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), which lets the app deduce who might be interesting to you. Click on the \"\"Places\"\" tab and you\\'ll see a list of locations in your area. Clicking on a location will surface a list of people at that spot (generated via Foursquare check-ins, etc. -- one doesn\\'t have to be using Sonar to show up in the app), and what level of connection you have to them -- how many Facebook friends, Twitter friends, etc. If you see someone you might want to stalk -- I mean, TALK to, you can tweet at them from within the app. You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalkage -- I mean, talkage -- as well. The app also features a \"\"People\"\" tab, listing which friends (pulled from your social networks) have currently checked in near you, as well as other people of interest. Use that to hook up with your pals next time they \"\"forget to tell you\"\" about karaoke. It\\'s not your fault the only lyrics you know are \"\"Wub wub wub wubwubwubwub wub Pzzzzzzz.\"\" Creepy: Highlight . You\\'re just your average tech-savvy businessman, all pimped out in front-pleated khakis, your startup-emblazoned T-shirt of choice, and, of course, your ubiquitous SXSW Interactive Platinum Badge swingin\\' around your neck. Reclining there on your barstool, sweating Mojito in hand, you cruise the room with your eyes. With whom should you birth your future children -- uh, I mean your latest business venture? Suddenly, your cell vibrates in your holster. You whip it out with delight to see ... a shiny new notification from Highlight. Could it be? Is your dreamboat partner in this very room?! SXSW fave Highlight is what is known as an \"\"ambient location-sharing app,\"\" which means that it is always on (unless you \"\"pause\"\" it), alerting others using the service to your whereabouts. When you first install the app, you\\'ll be asked to connect via Facebook, thus porting all your friends and interests into Highlight. From there on out, you\\'ll be alerted via push notifications every time someone of interest is nearby -- you know, folks with a lot of mutual friends, hobbies, taste in TV, etc. These interactions will also be stored in a kind of in-app log. From there, you have the option to check out their profiles and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting. You can also \"\"Highlight\"\" people for future reference, which is kind of the equivalent of a \"\"wink\"\" on an online dating site (IE a complete wuss move). That\\'s right, tech-savvy businessman, now you can meet all kinds of interesting people -- mere feet from your nervous self -- without the hassle of the initial awkward introduction. Highlight now, message one Mojito later. Meet IRL if they deign to answer you. Super creepy: Banjo . Your doll collection just isn\\'t cutting it anymore. Seriously, how much can one stretch one\\'s imagination when it comes to weaving background stories for inanimate objects? And QVC\\'s wares aren\\'t getting any cheaper. If only you could discover some brand new friends -- complete with dossiers (like the books that come with those American Girl dolls) -- with whom to maybe, possibly, someday but not likely hang out with. Well, you\\'ve got a friend in Banjo! Banjo serves two purposes: It alerts you when a friend is in your vicinity, and it gives you a glimpse into the lives of those around you -- and around the world. Upon downloading the iOS/Android app, you can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram and Google+ to keep track of all your friends. When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you (you can change the distance from one-fourth mile to 10), you\\'ll get an alert. If they\\'re using Banjo, you can send them a message in-app, and if they\\'re not, you can post a message to whatever content or check-in they shared, asking them to join the service. (We don\\'t recommend doing this unless you\\'re OK with someone putting cheesy words in your mouth like: \"\"How cool! Banjo tells me we\\'re close by, so let\\'s connect!) If the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling (\"\"Jesus Christ, who the F cares that you went to the bodega and bought dish soap?!\"\"), you can toggle over to the \"\"Explore\"\" map or the \"\"People\"\" box to check out a graphical representation of people in your area. That info is collected via check-ins/content as well, so users don\\'t have to be Banjo members to show up on your map. From there, you can click through whatever content they\\'re sharing -- tweets, Instagram photos, etc -- and live vicariously to your heart\\'s content. You can even message folks if they\\'re Banjo members (or spam them -- like your friends -- if they\\'re not). Bonus: Banjo also shows who has looked at you, so there\\'s plenty of opps for potential couples to awkwardly check out each other\\'s profiles until one of them breaks. The app even lets you creep internationally, virtually zooming around cities like Paris and London and anywhere else your heart desires. And you thought that Canadian Maple Leaf doll from the Babies A Bloom collection you bought last week was an international adventure!\",\"Sonar, Highlight and Banjo are a new wave of social apps that were all the buzz at SXSW .\\nSonar shows who is chilling at hot spots near you and who you might be interested to meet .\\nHighlight alerts you when people who share your interests are nearby .\\nBanjo lets you see whatever content -- tweets, photos, etc. -- nearby users are sharing .\"\\n003f8c8953025e086fa773c9b40d9b8cd6d9754c,\"Chelsea\\'s early season form may have led to comparisons with the Arsenal \\'Invincibles\\' side, but Gary Neville believes they aren\\'t even as good as the Chelsea side from 10 years ago.

Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 13:47 EST, 4 January 2012 . As Burberry today unveils its new spring/summer campaign in store windows and across social media networking sites, millions of ardent fans will be watching. Just last month, it was announced that the British company had become the world\\'s most successful\\xa0 luxury fashion brand on Facebook and Twitter, with a record 10million fans on Facebook, and almost 700,000 following the brand\\'s regular UK feed on Twitter. Meanwhile, they have thousands more global Twitter fans following their international feeds and post exclusive content on their own YouTube channel. Behind the scenes: Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne on set of the latest Burberry campaign . Burberry\\'s social media success has grown exponentially - and it is still growing fast. The secret, say consumer experts, is the fact that Burberry share so much unique content exclusively with their followers on social networking platforms, and post new and different content to each one. What is posted on Facebook will be different from that on Twitter, and dialogues are constantly being carried out across both. Just this morning, Burberry placed . three new videos from their latest campaign, starring My Week With . Marilyn star Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne, onto their YouTube channel. And at the news that the brand had . reached 10million Facebook fans, Burberry Chief Creative Officer Christopher . Bailey uploaded a personal thank you via a video message to the site. Days later, a further 163,000 had joined. At ease: The two chat between shots . All this direct contact gives fans that bit more involvement with the brand - and keeps them connected. \\'Christopher is really involved,\\' Burberry told MailOnline. \\'He has answered fans\\' questions personally on . Facebook, and he\\'s very active on Twitter.\\' \\'It gives people something new. It\\'s a direct and personal route for them.\\' Their groundbreaking, inclusive . approach goes against the practiced elitism of luxury brands, and ultimately brings . fans closer rather than keeping them at a distance. While other fashion houses operate . strict closed-door policies that isolate all but the inner circle - Tom . Ford famously showed his last collection to a tiny selection of invited . contacts, with no photographers and only a handful of select Press allowed - Burberry have . embraced this public approach. Indeed, Burberry was the world\\'s first . fashion house to \\'Tweettalk\\', posting images from its autumn/winter fashion show on to . Twitter - . before the models had even stepped out onto the catwalk. The innovative move meant fans . were able to see the collection before the celebrity front row and the . fashion Press had even caught a glimpse. For his part, current star of the . campaign Eddie Redmayne reports that Christopher Bailey is, as one would . expect from his democratic approach to business, a \\'gem of a man\\' \\'I am a huge fan of Christopher Bailey,\\' he says. \\'He is a brilliant designer and a brilliant man. \\'The fashion world can be a tad intimidating but Christopher remains a kind, grounded gem of a man. And judging by the latest figures, there are at least 10 million people out there who agree. Intense: Cara, 18, has been the face of Burberry since January last year, when she appeared in the brand\\'s S/S11 campaign .

Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq\\'s US ambassador says his country needs America\\'s help to prevent \\'a thousand\\' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery . \\'Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,\\' Obama said in public remarks. \\'So this should be a wake-up call.\\xa0 Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.\\' But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. \\'These are all \"\"nice to have\"\" discussions,\\' he said, but \\'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.\\' \\'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?\\' Amanpour interrupted, \\'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?\\' \\'We\\'re not saying we\\'re not happy to [have a] discussion,\\' he responded. \\'We want to have that discussion. But we\\'re saying conditioning that discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question.\\' \\'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.\\' \\'No POWs,\\' he warned. \\'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.\\' \\'That\\'s the situation in Iraq.\\' Obama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They will be \\'armed for combat,\\' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won\\'t be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. An administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of ISIS. Obama is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq. Amanpour pushed back against Faily, arguing that the more \\'immediate threat\\' to Iraq was political inequality enforced by Shiites against Sunnis . ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries . \\'A thousand of them\\': Faily says the late Osama bin Laden (pictured), who masterminded al-Qaeda\\'s 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning is ISIS is allowed to press forward . Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged Iran at a time when that Islamic republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. Faily said Monday that whether or not the White House decides on a path of limited cooperation with Tehran, Iraq needs help urgently. \\'We have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. ... The administration now understands that urgency.\\' he said. They have been willing to say, \"\"We are willing to help.\"\" What we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow.

The Hammond is hosting the Small Group of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS at Lancaster House in London . Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by events in Iraq and Syria. \\'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain\\'s national security at the moment,\\' the Foreign Secretary told BBC1\\'s Breakfast. \\'There\\'s a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria. \\'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we\\'ve been very successful in doing so, but we mustn\\'t be complacent. \\'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.\\' David Cameron met Iraq\\'s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Downing Street ahead of the security summit in London .

They face sentences of up to six months for allowing a boy or girl of primary school age to take part in the sport – described as\\xa0 ‘barbaric’ by the Culture Secretary. And a Preston social club which hosted the boys’ fight reported in the Mail yesterday is to be investigated over whether it broke its licence conditions. The revelations come after a video emerged showing Kian MacKinson, nine, and a boy of eight, whose father has requested he remain anonymous, kicking, shoving and grappling in front of baying adults. The footage caused outrage among child and medical experts, who called for a police and social services investigation. Brutal: Child cage fighting can continue despite the boys being filmed without padding or head gear . Upsetting: The young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight, and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a Preston working club . Battle: Kian MacKinson, nine, with an eight-year-old whose father has asked for his face to be obscured . Parental support: Kian with his father Nick Hartley, the youngster features in the shocking video which shows hundreds of baying adults goading the primary-age boys to fight each other . A source at the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘A young child being forced to take part in any violent sport could constitute child cruelty. As such, a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12-week sentence or a maximum 26-week sentence.’ Social services bosses in Lancashire\\xa0 confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the cage fighting, which is also known as mixed martial arts, to ‘consider any child safety concerns’. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘barbaric’. ‘Getting more young people doing sport is great but I do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage,’ he said. ‘It feels very barbaric and I know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that.’ He added he was ‘shocked and surprised’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments. His comments came after the British Medical Association, the NSPCC and . Safechild branded child cage fighting ‘disturbing and sick’. A British . Association of Martial Arts spokesman insisted: ‘Children this young . shouldn’t be involved in cage fighting.’ Lancashire Police officers have decided to take no further action either on a child safety level or licensing of the premises. It emerged last night, however, that council chiefs have ordered a . licence review for the Greenlands Labour Club and will ask the venue not . to put on any similar events involving juveniles. The deputy leader of Preston City Council, John Swindells, said: ‘I am . appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking . place in Preston. ‘Having checked the club’s licence there is a condition that children . should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and I think it . needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached. Professional appearance: Just like in an adult event, the tiny fighters have an entourage. Seconds out: The boys are brought together in the middle of the cage fighting ring, prepared to do battle . Grappling: The pair begin their fight slowly, testing out the space between them as they start their bout . ‘As such, I have now made a request for the licence at Greenlands Labour Club to be reviewed. A formal licensing review process will now follow.’ That could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter. A similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say. The shocking video that emerged on Wednesday shows Kian and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear. One of them is shown apparently receiving medical attention for a leg injury and bursting into tears. Fight: Before long, they have hit the canvas and take turns in pinning each other down . Young fighters: The children wear no padding or headguards for the ten minute bout in Preston . The event was held almost a fortnight ago with about 250 adults paying £25 a ticket to watch 14 fights. The other clashes involved semi-professional adults. Sources said the night was a boisterous alcohol-fuelled affair. Sharefight, the company commissioned to film the event, said the video had been removed from the internet ‘out of respect’ for parents and others who had shown concern. The event took place in a ‘safe environment’, a spokesman added. Greenlands Labour Club has also defended its decision to hold the event. Time out: Scantily clad ring girls parade on the canvas in between rounds .

Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6. The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. Indication: The two women accused of drug smuggling might enter guilty pleas to secure transfers to UK jails . But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story. They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing.

Nunes\\' book, for example, contained this line in chapter one: \\'For six years, he had put up with her overt stares and innuendos because she was not only his boss and sole owner of the gallery but also his friend.\\' Rushton\\'s first chapter included a similar line, according to a screen shot posted online by Nunes: \\'For ten years, I\\'d tolerated her overt stares and innuendos because she was part owner of our gallery and always seemed to find opportunities with new clients that helped the gallery that I could not.\\' Rushton appeared to be recasting the niche Christian story Nunes wrote into a book that would appeal to a mainstream romance reader looking for a more erotic tale, she said. \\'It really is the thing that sells the most,\\' said Nunes, who has written 47 books in the last 18 years. In email exchanges between Rushton and Nunes, Rushton said the idea came from a friend who died in a car wreck and that she didn\\'t want to reveal her real name because she is Mormon and her extended family wouldn\\'t approve of her writing, according to the suit. Nunes said she\\'s confirmed Mullens and Rushton are the same woman, though she declined to provide details, citing the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Davis School District confirmed that Rushton has been a third-grade teacher since 1993. After their exchange, Nunes says negative reviews began popping up on Amazon.com, Facebook and other websites. She alleges that Rushton created seven different profiles in an attempt to discredit her. Nunes is seeking at least $150,000 in damages as well as attorney\\'s fees in the suit, which was first reported by the Ogden Standard-Examiner. Since filing it, Nunes says she\\'s heard from other authors whose work has also been copied from their e-books. The books are often pulled when the plagiarism is identified but later reposted under a different name. \\'It\\'s so much easier ... online, you can be so anonymous,\\' she said. \\'How many authors can afford to take someone to court?

This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle . to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on . the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London . Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some . officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of . shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in . organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on . Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark\\xa0 Cavendish at the Help . the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police . Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but . comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for . purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes . officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month . ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could . face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards . set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail . regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style . assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male . officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese . and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review . some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot . complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment . should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just . because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very . fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull). \\xa0\\xa0You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine.

It\\'s not traditional, and it kind of goes against one of the biggest perks of being a king or queen -- a secure job for life. But it happens, as the world saw Monday. King Juan Carlos I of Spain became the latest royal to say he\\'s stepping down. It\\'s \"\"time to hand over to a new generation,\"\" the 76-year-old announced in a televised address, declaring that he\\'s leaving the job he\\'s had for nearly four decades. His son, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, will take over. The Spanish King is one of several monarchs to step down in recent years. Queen B takes her leave . In January 2013, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands passed the crown to her son Prince Willem-Alexander. He was 46 at the time. Queen Beatrix had been ruling for more than three decades. Much beloved by the Dutch people, she tried to assure them that her retirement didn\\'t mean she was taking off for Florida and forsaking their love. \"\"This doesn\\'t mean that I\\'m taking leave from you,\"\" she told a throng of admirers in Dam Square outside the palace in Amsterdam. Her abdication was a move marked by tradition in the Netherlands -- knowing that it\\'s best to go out while on top, historians say. Queen Beatrix was the third successive Dutch monarch to abdicate, following her grandmother and her mother. \"\"Beatrix\\'s abdication wasn\\'t controversial,\"\" explained royal commentator and historian Richard Fitzwilliams. \"\"The people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy.\"\" A father to son handoff in Belgium . In July 2013, King Albert II of Belgium gave up his kingship, reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties. Those duties include \"\"suggesting, advising, warning and encouraging\"\" lawmakers in the country, according to Belgium\\'s government website. King Albert was 79 when he retired. He had ruled for 20 years. His son, a 53-year-old trained fighter pilot who became King Philippe, took over. The country had been in turmoil at the time, torn between the North and South where residents spoke different languages. A pope quits (and makes history) Europe must have been especially lovely in 2013, because even the Pope didn\\'t want to keep working. An unprecedented \"\"I quit\"\" came in February when the Vatican announced that Pope Benedict XVI -- Germany\\'s Joseph Ratzinger -- was leaving the papacy. His \"\"advanced age\"\" was the reason he wanted out, the Vatican said. The then-85-year-old had led the Catholic church since 2005. He became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post. So what do monarchs -- and one pope -- do when they retire? Benedict\\'s retirement hasn\\'t been all that different from anyone else\\'s. Archbishop Georg Ganswein told Reuters that Benedict has been doing a lot of reading, reflecting and praying. He\\'s taking walks in the Vatican gardens, playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery. He\\'s mostly a homebody, making only a few public appearances, such as the canonization ceremonies for Popes John XXIII and John Paul II in April. A change of the guard in Qatar . Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013. Sheikh Hamad, who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father, sent out a public message to announce his plans. \"\"I declare that I will hand over the reins of power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and I am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility, deserving the confidence, capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission,\"\" according to the Independent. Sheikh Hamad\\'s decision to cede power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. His son, Sheikh Tamim, became the youngest monarch in the region at the age of 33. Spanish selfies and change . In Spain on Monday after the King announced his departure, tourists took selfies in front of the royal palace in Madrid. Some gazed through the gates. \"\"Change is good, new blood could be good, why not?\"\" said Spaniard Natividad Andres. \"\"Everything is so unpredictable, you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work.\"\" Lola Garcia told Reuters that she worried about what the abdication indicated. \"\"It\\'s a shame. I\\'m really sorry,\"\" she said. \"\"I don\\'t know what\\'s going to become of Spain and I don\\'t like what I see coming.\"\" On Monday, the King noted in his speech that Spain had been suffering financially. \"\"The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,\"\" he said. Royal watcher Fitzwilliams called King Juan Carlos\\' abdication a \"\"real tragedy.\"\" \"\"He wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparate Spain,\"\" Fitzwilliams said. \"\"Spaniards -- many of them older -- are great admirers of him.\"\" There was still a \"\"tremendous amount of good will\"\" toward the King, he said, despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule. King Juan Carlos\\' popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip in Botswana, and Spanish news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot. The image appalled many Spaniards. Fitzwilliams recalled Monday, however, that the King had, in his long rule, managed to bring together fractious political groups in Spain and stop a right-wing military coup in 1981. \"\"He\\'s done the country enormous service,\"\" Fitzwilliams said. Could a British royal be next? The news of King Juan Carlos\\' abdication didn\\'t shock British author and historian Kate Williams. \"\"We\\'ve seen this in Belgium and the Netherlands,\"\" she said. \"\"I think it\\'s often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vibrant and fun. But you will never see it in the United Kingdom. Never.\"\" Queen Elizabeth II has said that she believes the job of ruling Britain was given to her by God, and only God can take it away, Williams said. The queen staying in her job is critical to a cohesive sense of culture in Britain, she said. But it\\'s happened before in the U.K. There\\'s no way Queen Elizabeth doesn\\'t consider the shock waves sent through British society when King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936. That \"\"haunts\"\" the palace still, Fitzwilliams said. King Edward caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, an act that broke the rules of the Church of England. He gave up the throne and became the Duke of Windsor. Together, the couple toured Germany. It was reported that the former king had Nazi sympathies. He lived out the rest of his life in France. The episode is considered, Fitzwilliams said, a shame on the legacy of the British monarchy.\",\"Netherlands, Belgium and Qatar all had monarchs step down in 2013 .\\nKing Juan Carlos I of Spain announced Monday he would abdicate .\\nRoyal watcher says there\\'s no chance Queen Elizabeth would give up throne .\"\\n004f0f8c694c4b546b29565a8993a555537ff561,\"PUBLISHED: . 07:04 EST, 9 January 2014 . | .

A team of archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) are working with volunteers on a four-year excavation project at the site, which overlooks the small village of Hallaton. Vicki Score, ULAS project manager, says the skeletons were placed together in this position, as there was enough room in the grave to have them buried apart. Aside from the bonded couple, 11 skeletons have been found so far, which are yet to be analyzed, but some discoveries have been made already. Score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe. Another, she says, was in his mid-twenties, with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life. \"\"He was buried in a very unusual position in a pit with his legs splayed widely apart, arms flexed at the elbows and hands tucked beneath his chin. \"\"We have no idea why he was buried like this -- it could possibly be due to a medical condition.\"\" Both skeletons also had lesions on their skulls which suggest they had head lice. The team are hoping to find out more about how the gravesite was chosen. Score says: \"\"We have seen similar skeletons before from Leicester where a couple has been buried together in a single grave. The main question we find ourselves asking is why were they buried up there?\"\" It is thought the chapel may have served as a pilgrimage, or the main church possibly refused to bury the bodies because they were criminals, foreigners or diseased. She adds that Roman archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there, which made it a special place. Other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site, fragments of stone masonry, wall plaster, tiles and lead from the windows. Silver pennies dating between the 12th and 16th centuries give clues as to when the chapel was in use. In 2000, the Hallaton Treasure was discovered, consisting of Iron Age coins, parts of Roman helmets and debris from feasting. The county was also where the remains of 15th-century monarch Richard III were uncovered beneath a parking lot in 2012, raising questions about how the controversial ruler lived and died.\",\"Two skeletons were found holding hands, buried at a lost chapel in Leicester .\\n11 skeletons have been found so far, but are yet to be analyzed .\\nEarly findings suggest one died by being struck on the head with a pole axe .\\nLeicester was also the site where the remains of King Richard III were found .\"\\n00512126d65bf2a36801e4ef37f28c86c29deb28,\"(CNN)The New York Police Department faced a newly pressing question in recent weeks: What constitutes an online \"\"threat\"\"? Police reviewed hundreds of online postings--and made several arrests--over alleged anti-cop threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month. It used to be a lot easier to define threats.  It\\'s not that our dialogue has evolved much.  It hasn\\'t.  Art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms, whether it\\'s in rap lyrics or Guns N\\' Roses songs.   Kids have consumed violent art and speech since long before Hansel and Gretel baked a witch in an oven, or Beowulf hacked his way through Southern Scandinavia. The difference today is the delivery system: the Internet and social media. Suppose, after the recent NYPD threats, I posted that I planned to \"\"swarm on any m... in a blue uniform,\"\" meaning specifically the \"\"punk police.\"\" Suppose I promise that \"\"when I finish, it is going to be a bloodbath of cops dyin.\\'\"\" Scary right?  If I tweeted that today, I might expect police at my door.  In 1988, though, there was no Twitter ... or e-mail ... or \"\"online,\"\" come to think of it, when the rap group NWA came out with its (famous) \"\"F*** Tha Police,\"\" containing those very lyrics.  People then were offended, of course.  But songs on an album just don\\'t seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today. There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercially mass-produced cassette tape. And when a megastar like Axl Rose sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much, and bury her in his backyard,  millions heard those lyrics.  That\\'s a much bigger audience than the 13 followers reading some guy\\'s rabid musings on Twitter. So, threatening speech online is not about how viral or far-reaching it is. Our society is not as interested in protecting social media rants as it is in protecting artists because—whether the courts say it or not—we really don\\'t feel as good about protecting dummies.  We will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists, even if we find their work repulsive. Instinctively, however, we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of, say, a bitter child custody dispute and access to a Wi-Fi signal.  It seems that if some shmendrik wants to rant on the Internet, he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like \"\"lyrics.\"\" That analysis dovetails nicely with the issues before the Supreme Court in a case called Elonis v. United States.  In Elonis, an \"\"aspiring rapper\"\" used violent language on Facebook to rant about his wife, an elementary school and an FBI agent. Under the First Amendment, the court must decide whether a \"\"threat\"\" requires proof of the defendant\\'s actual intent to threaten, or if it is enough to show that a \"\"reasonable person\"\" would regard the statement as threatening.  If the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent, that test would be a higher burden, and more favorable to defendants.  But even under the \"\"reasonable person\"\" standard favored by prosecutors, the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat. Maybe this is why social media has more threat potential, and it\\'s not because it can reach many persons: Social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific person—but be overheard by many others.  Maybe that\\'s the key. In that sense, social media threats are less like a musical performance, and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear, or a call surreptitiously recorded by your Russian girlfriend (as with Mel Gibson). Social media postings are (generally) not for profit, and they are authored by the speaker alone.  In that sense they feel more like the unfiltered statements of present intent. As protective as we should be of free speech in art, maybe it\\'s time to draw the line at social media.  Then again, I\\'m biased in a way that perhaps the justices are not.  I\\'m on social media, and the tweets directed at me from time to time are, let\\'s say, pretty threatening and too profane to reprint here. Maybe the justices would be less inclined to equate the lyrics of Eminem (as Justice John Roberts recently did)  with the poetic musings of frighteningly abusive tweeters if they had more personal experience with social media. The NYPD confronts a similar problem.  How is it to know the difference between a true threat, the work of an artist, or some troll sounding off online? The Supreme Court may contain the brightest minds of our time, but compared with your average 14-year-old, they are Luddites.  I\\'ve never seen a hashtag in a Supreme Court opinion, and I seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on Instagram.  Tasked as they are with defining threats on social media, will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate—or threaten—online? Even if they do, by then the kids will be onto the next thing anyway .\",\"Danny Cevallos: Arrests over tweets threatening NYPD raise issue of when speech is threat .\\nHe says Supreme Court to weigh in soon.

A year ago talkSPORT,\\xa0managed to dupe some Blues supporters into believing that their club was linked with various players during the January transfer window - only for those names to be made up.And 12 months on, the radio station has been at it again\\xa0outside Stamford Bridge - with the theme being of Star Wars characters this time around dubbed as \\'Transfer Wars\\'.

Binks, a centre back or a left winger from the MLS, is described by one fan as the \\'new John Terry,\\' while another says he will be a good signing on the flanks. Bacca is mentioned to play in the similar mould of his older \\'brother\\' Carlos - the Sevilla and Colombia international striker. Unlike his 28-year-old \\'sibling\\' though, Bacca\\'s main \\'attributes\\' are his ability to play as a target man. The 6ft 5in forward would be a welcome addition according to the Blues faithful and is seen as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba. \\'Stew Bacca\\' was seen by fans as an ideal replacement for club legend Didier Drogba . \\'Artur Detur\\' like JJ Binks is another young prospect who can play both as a centre back or as a left winger . Detur, like Binks, has the rare tactical flexibility to play in the heart of defence and or on the left flank - a trait that Chelsea supporters clearly feel would be a bonus commodity. The France star\\'s potential arrival is one relished by the west London faithful, although one fan believes he needs another season before he can make a real impact at the club. Although the force is not with all Chelsea supporters, two were switched on to the prank. Upon hearing of Binks a male duo state that they have \\'never heard of him,\\' before querying that the MLS prospect \\'sounds like something out of Star Wars.\\' The duo\\'s suspicions are confirmed upon hearing Detur\\'s name but alas if only their fellow supporters were as clued up.

A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a \\'full frontal attack\\' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today. The same corporate partner was also said to have criticised Katie Tantum, 33, for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night in the office on a major project. Miss Tantum was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. But she claims the firm \\'just stopped bothering\\' with her when they discovered she was pregnant. Katie Tantum is suing law firm Travers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant . Miss Tantum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm\\'s head of real estate. Now she is suing for loss of earnings. Helen Croke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Tantum’s progress that the Cambridge graduate \\'lacked drive and enthusiasm\\' and made mistakes on important documents. She said: \\'I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate. \\'It was a not a good review. Clearly corporate wasn’t a good seat for her.\\' When comparing Miss Tantum\\'s review with that of another trainee, Ms Croke said it was like \\'comparing apples and oranges.\\' She said Miss Tantum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night. She added: \\'Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares. \\'Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect. \\'I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katie’s work on transactions were poor. \\'When you’re in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee. \\'I can’t believe she didn’t know she was making mistakes.\\' Miss Tantum\\'s lawyer accused Ms Croke of launching a \\'full frontal attack\\' on Miss Tantum in her witness statement after she said the plaintiff \\'gave the impression she didn’t want to do what she was doing\\'. The tribunal also heard that Ms Croke was \\'very critical\\' of Miss Tantum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.30am because she did not feel well. David Massarella, representing Miss Tantum, said: \\'You made a comment on her leaving work in the middle of the night. \\'She knows she left at 6.30am. She knows that because she went to Pret, which does not open until then.\\' Ms Croke denies criticising Miss Tantum\\'s behaviour that night. In March last year, Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. In her witness statement she said: \\'I told my supervisor, Mahesh Varia, who seemed supportive and thanked me for telling him. Miss Tantum said she was criticised for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night . \\'But Mr Mahesh just stopped bothering with me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating.\\' Miss Tantum, who is fluent in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her. She said: \\'I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.\\' The firm\\'s head of real estate told the hearing he was \\'delighted\\' to find out Miss Tantum was pregnant. Julian Bass said: \\'Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasn’t surprised because of her age and so on. \\'I was genuinely delighted.\\' But despite a glowing review from Mr Bass, Miss Tantum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees. He said: \\'She was a strong contender in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skills which could make her a good real estate lawyer.\\' The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by \\'mute\\' partners when discussing Miss Tantum’s future at the firm. Ms Croke said: \\'I don’t believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Travers Smith.\\' The hearing continues.\",\"Katie Tantum claims she was criticised for leaving early after working through the night at law firm Travers Smith .\\nFirm partner Helen Croke said Miss Tantum lacked drive and enthusiasm .\"\\n0055d0207fa47067895280bb1066720c68872ed7,\"Germany captain Philipp Lahm claims his team can live with the pressure of the demands to become world champions for a fourth time.

The extent to which mobile phones act as ‘spies in our pockets’ has been exposed\\xa0 by a senior Tory MP. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis discovered how closely we can be watched when he asked his phone provider for the information it held on him – and found it could track his every move. Mr Davis investigated after American whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the security services were forcing phone companies to hand over\\xa0 data on their customers. The campaigning MP, who writes about his discoveries in today’s Mail on Sunday, says the list of times and\\xa0 co-ordinates – known as metadata – showed ‘where\\xa0 I had been at any one time for a year’.

No Neymar means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted Brazil for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the World Cup on home soil. That appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2-1 win against Colombia in a pulsating quarter-final were tinged with\\xa0 sadness. Neymar’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra, an X-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president Dilma Rousseff took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery.

Hundreds of bright yellow replica No 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment, crested hairstyles drooped around Brazil and bookmakers, for the first time, decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win. Neymar will not play again in this tournament. The initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and, while parallels can be drawn with Pele — the original\\xa0 No 10 who also hailed from the\\xa0 Santos club and was fouled out of a World Cup, ending Brazilian hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom. Leading the campaign was David Luiz, climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air. Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury . Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star . Not only is he scoring precious goals, like the brilliant free-kick against Colombia, but the centre-half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses. ‘To play in a semi-final of the World Cup is a dream,’ said Luiz. ‘When I was young, I dreamed of days like this but I am sad because Neymar is out of the competition. \\'He is like my brother. He is a great guy, a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football: happiness and magic. ‘Brazil will suffer a lot from this loss but Neymar will help us with his happiness. We have made a pact to support him. He will grow taller from this moment. It would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him.’ Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery . Devastated: Neymar is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home . Thanks: Neymar managed a wave as he left for Sao Paulo . Inside the squad, Neymar is so much more than an icon of youth culture. You can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training, where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else. True, he is their most gifted creative force, capable of lifting Brazil out of the ordinary, but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond-studded 22-year-old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions. ‘Neymar is a boy who fights a lot,’ said Luiz. ‘He dreamed about playing in a World Cup and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided.’ Colombia’s Juan Zuniga is Brazil’s new public enemy, the man who rammed his knee into the base of Neymar’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter-final. Support: Brazilian model Gisele Budnchen said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot . Team spirit: Leo Messi also took to social media to wish his Barcelona teammate a speedy recovery . Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari claimed his star man had been ‘hunted’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament. Neymar suffered a knee injury against Chile when he was cut down in full flight. The Brazil manager, however, swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong-arm tactics on Friday in a bid to silence James Rodriguez, of Colombia. Luiz added: ‘I never crucify players. You do things when you are emotional and don’t think. \\'I will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to\\xa0 injure him, then I think he will feel sad. If he just tried to stop the game that’s natural, that’s football.’ Brazil captain Thiago Silva offered support for Zuniga. ‘I know him from Serie A and he does not have any nastiness in him,’ said PSG defender Silva, who was formerly at AC Milan. ‘What he did was rash but I know it can be difficult to get the ball from Neymar.’ The challenge is to prove there is life after Neymar for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat. Without him, they will fret about how much they can create from open play. National icon: The Barcelona forward is by far the most popular player in Luiz Felipe Scolari\\'s squad . Against Chile and Colombia, the goals came from centre-halves Luiz, who scored twice, and Silva, all from set-pieces. Who wins most of these free-kicks and corners? Neymar, by dribbling at defenders. In his absence, there will be a greater onus on others. Oscar is expected to return to a central role, which he will relish, and his Chelsea team-mate Willian is among the candidates to come in against Germany in Belo Horizonte. Almost as bad for Scolari is the loss of Silva. The captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar\\'s injured back, highlighting the broken bone . Silva was magnificent in the\\xa0 quarter-final on Friday. He is the team’s strongest and most reliable defender, providing the stability which allows Luiz to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack. The loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder Luiz Gustavo after a one-match ban but will still be keenly felt. ‘This is the moment to show the strength of the squad,’ said Silva. ‘This moment could mark the start of a revolution for us. \\'We have proposed to win the World Cup for Neymar.

It could give us more determination to win.’\",\"Neymar out of the tournament after injury late in the quarter-final .\\nBrazil players rally round their star forward .\\nDavid Luiz pledges to \\'win and celebrate with him\\'\\nCaptain Thiago Silva says It could give us more determination to win.’\"\\n00579a91246db0df52a7106cc6650c56c9fbc604,\"By .

Lorna Driver-Davies, NutriCentre Nutritional Therapist, said: \\'My initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon Dr Perricone suggests is consumed to achieve results. \\'NHS advice says males and women past child-bearing age (or those who will not conceive) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week. Women of child-bearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week. \\'This is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish, especially the heavy metal mercury which is toxic. As a nutritionist I would therefore not recommend someone eat this much salmon for any kind of diet. \\'If they wanted to achieve the same effect, they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is certified as being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants. \\'The rest of the diet is actually really good - particularly almonds, berries and plant oils such as olive oil - think how good Mediterranean skin often looks.\\' Brains behind the business: Dr Perricone (L) takes a \\'no knife\\' approach to anti-ageing and believes the key lies in healthy foods rich in fatty acids.

But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Big Huge Games studio general manager Sean Dunn was working in Los Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on \"\"Reckoning.\"\" After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. \"\"This is a passionate and competitive group who want to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),\"\" Dunn said. \"\"This team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studios. These people believe in what they are doing.\"\" Dunn said the new \"\"Reckoning\"\" game contains more than 10 novels\\' worth of back story from best-selling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,000 to 50,000 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Todd McFarlane and the gaming vision of Ken Rolston. But his team of 110 people was tasked with bringing all that creative energy to life. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamics and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Big Huge Games team could make a game as big as it envisioned. \"\"It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, in where it was \\'We are making a huge game, and it\\'s going to be great,\\' \"\" Quadara told CNN. \"\"Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything.\"\" The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic role-playing game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gaming while still presenting a cohesive story. \"\"There\\'s this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,\"\" he said. \"\"The engine itself is a full-on action game, fighting game engine, but it\\'s also a full-on RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other.\"\" If trying to design hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,000 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Tim Coman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. \"\"You stop worrying about pedaling and just keep moving,\"\" Coman said. \"\"You just take each individual step as it\\'s coming and focus on \\'We\\'re going to get this done, going to get this done.\\' \"\" \"\"There\\'s a depth there that you know walking in, you\\'re going to be building lots and lots of stuff,\"\" he added. \"\"Ken Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he\\'s fantastic. He and I would have conversations daily. How do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?\"\" Coman\\'s artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear visually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to gamers\\' sense of exploration. \"\"R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we\\'ve repeated around here: \\'If you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.\\' For us, we wanted to put all that in there so that the players that really are RPG fanatics can see this is a real-deal RPG. And [for] the people that are action-game players, it is a real-deal action game.\"\" Both Coman and Quadara admit they don\\'t know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of \"\"Reckoning.\"\" \"\"Take the blue pill,\"\" Coman said while laughing. \"\"Don\\'t even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels\\' worth of writing, just in the game itself,\"\" Quadara added. \"\"The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they\\'ve contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head.\"\" However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. \"\"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning\"\" is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.

Damien Gayle . A Palestinian man was arrested today in connection with the murders of three Israeli teenagers as warplanes hammered 10 targets in Gaza. Soldiers swooped on a home just after midnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli forces have concentrated their search for the killers. The arrest came after protests over the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager spread yesterday from Jerusalem to Arab towns in northern Israel. Scroll down for video . An Israeli military vehicle patrols the West bank city of Hebron this morning, around the same time that soldiers arrested a Palestinian man in connection with the murders of three Jewish teenagers killed near the city . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. The Israeli Defence Force would not elaborate on the arrest . An American teenager - the cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy - who was beaten and detained by police during the protests in east Jerusalem was today brought before an Israeli court. Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted what the Israelis claimed were rocket launchers and a weapons workshop in the Gaza Strip, after 29 rockets and mortars were fired into Israeli territory. Relations between Israel and Palestine have been tense since Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel were abducted on June 12, leading to a massive Israeli military operation in Palestinian areas. They were later found dead in a shallow grave, a discovery quickly followed by the the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was snatched from his home in East Jerusalem. His burned body was found in a forest. Palestinian officials said a post-mortem indicated the 16-year old had been burned alive. Israeli police say they are still investigating the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, but Palestinians say Israeli extremists murdered him to avenge the deaths of the three Israelis. The three Israeli seminary students (from L-R) Naftali Fraenkel, 16, who also holds U.S. citizenship, Gil-Ad Shaer, 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19, whose killings have sparked the current round of violence . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. His arrest came as violence spread from Jerusalem to Arab communities across northern Israel, with with hundreds of people throwing rocks and fire bombs at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said police had arrested 22 Israeli Arabs. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights, but still face discrimination from the \\'Jewish State\\'. Even so, violent riots like those that occurred yesterday are rare. Clashes had mostly subsided by early this morning, but the situation remained tense. U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, left, 15, was beaten by police when he was arrested on Thursday after a protest over the murder of his cousin, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, right, became a violent clash with Israeli police . Police today asked a Jerusalem court to extend the detention of 15-year-old U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, who was badly beaten by police during the clashes. He is the cousin of murdered Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir. His parents say their son, who goes to school in Florida, was the last person with Mohammed shortly before he was snatched. They said Tariq left Mohammed to eat before the Ramadan fast began at dawn Wednesday, and Mohammed was seized shortly afterward.

Police said Tariq Abu Khdeir resisted arrest, attacked officers, and was captured with a slingshot for lobbing stones. Abu Khdeir\\'s face was masked in a keffiyeh, an Arab headscarf that some Palestinian protesters wore during the clashes to conceal their identity, police added. He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day. Amateur video of what Tariq\\'s father Salah said was the beating aired on a local television station, and he said he could recognize his son from his clothing. Pictures of the boy taken after his arrest showed his face badly swollen. The U.S. State Department said it was \\'profoundly troubled\\' by reports of his beating and demanded an investigation.

Wales fly-half Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys\\' best attacking moments as full-back Dan Evans touched down twice, while wing Jeff Hassler, scrum-half Rhys Webb and number eight Dan Baker also scored tries. Treviso wing Ludovico Nitoglia scored a late consolation try, converted by former Worcester and Wasps fly-half Joe Carlisle, but there was little for the Italians to cheer on another dismal European occasion for them. Dan Evans scores his second, and Osprey\\'s fifth, try of the match in what was a routine win over Treviso . It meant the unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Pool Five, teeing up nicely next Saturday\\'s clash against reigning Aviva Premiership champions Northampton at Franklin\\'s Gardens. Saints will start as favourites - they beat Ospreys twice in last season\\'s Heineken Cup - but Biggar and company can head to the East Midlands confident of making an impression. The only worrying note on an otherwise routine afternoon was Wales autumn squad hopeful Baker being carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury. There was a 10-minute stoppage while Baker received attention from medics. Dan Biggar ran the show, kicking 17 points and orchestrating Ospreys\\' best attacking moments . Treviso, back in Swansea little more than a month after they suffered a 44-13 PRO12 defeat against the Ospreys, were soon under pressure when Biggar sparked a brilliant counter-attack from deep inside home territory. And although Treviso halted that move, two successful Biggar penalties during the opening eight minutes hinted at a long shift to come for the lowest-ranked team in this season\\'s competition. There was a fluency about Ospreys\\' play and after Biggar completed his penalty hat-trick inside 13 minutes, their opening try arrived shortly afterwards following strong set-piece play, slick handling and a neat Biggar pass than sent Hassler over. Biggar added the conversion, and Ospreys were well on their way to a potential bonus-point victory, leading 16-0 early in the second quarter of a one-sided encounter. Dan\\xa0Baker was carried off midway through the second period after suffering what appeared to be a neck injury . Treviso\\'s cause was not helped by the loss through injury of captain Antonio Pavanello, and they were then temporarily reduced to 14 players when Pavanello\\'s replacement Marco Fuser was sin-binned by French referee Pascal Gauzere for pulling down a maul deep inside his team\\'s 22. Ospreys then kept up the pressure, and Webb sniped his way over for a sixth try in seven starts this term - form that suggests he will strongly challenge Mike Phillips to wear the Wales number nine shirt against opening autumn Test series opponents Australia on November 8 - and Biggar\\'s conversion made it 23-0. The Ospreys forwards looked to maintain their grip in the second period, and their dominance led to a further Treviso indiscretion that saw substitute prop Salesi Manu yellow-carded, which as with Fuser\\'s caution cost the visitors dear. Justin Tipuric of Ospreys is tackled by Treviso\\'s Italian No 8 Alessandro Zanni . Within a minute of Manu\\'s exit, the Ospreys struck for their third try when Evans grounded possession underneath a pile of bodies, and Biggar\\'s conversion left Treviso 30 points adrift with more than 30 minutes remaining. The bonus-point try arrived with just 54 minutes gone as Treviso\\'s defence found itself scattered to all parts, enabling Baker to enjoy an unopposed run-in before Biggar maintained his 100 per cent success rate by landing a seventh successful kick from seven attempts. Baker\\'s injury did not noticeably disrupt the Ospreys\\' rhythm, and their fifth try arrived 17 minutes from time following a sharp break and a superbly-timed scoring pass by the impressive Webb to an unmarked Evans. Treviso showed plenty of commitment and desire, despite the scoreline, but their technical, tactical and skill limitations mean it will be a major surprise if they win a European game this season, especially as their other pool opponents are Northampton and Racing Metro. With the game long done as a contest, Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy had all eight of his substitutes on well before the end, including Wales internationals Justin Tipuric, Aaron Jarvis and Duncan Jones, but he knows the European campaign is about to crank up considerably as Northampton lie in wait.\",\"Ospreys beat Treviso 42-7 in their\\xa0Champions\\xa0Cup opener .\\nDan Biggar kicked 17 points and played well throughout .\\nDan Evans, Jeff Hassler, Rhys Webb and Dan Baker all scored tries .\"\\n005ed10e2fa927c69aa9d881c51ccca9ce2c789c,\"Outgoing Iowa Democratic Sen.

Claire Ellicott . A young patient who died of dehydration at a leading teaching hospital phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty, an inquest heard yesterday. Officers arrived at Kane Gorny\\'s bedside, but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away. The keen footballer and runner, 22, died of dehydration a few hours later. Hospital: Kane Gorny, 22, pictured with his mother Rita, needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer. However, during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication . A coroner had such grave concerns about the case that she referred it to police. Yesterday an inquest was told how Mr . Gorny died after blunders and neglect by \\'lazy and careless\\' medical . staff at St George\\'s Hospital in Tooting, South London. His mother Rita Cronin, a civil . servant told Westminster Coroner\\'s Court that staff tutted at her and . repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son hadn\\'t been . given vital medication. At one point he became so desperate . and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night . before his death, his mother said, he was not checked on by medical . staff, despite being in a room on his own. Following his death, a nurse allegedly . inquired whether the family, from Balham, South-West London, was . \\'finished\\' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could \\'bag . him up\\'. Mr Gorny, who worked in Waitrose and . was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer, had survived a . malignant brain tumour in 2008. Inquest: Rita Cronin, left, and Kane\\'s father Peter Gorny arriving at their son\\'s inquest. Rita told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright . The cancer affected his pituitary . gland, which controls the body\\'s mechanisms, such as fluid levels. Part . of his treatment included a course of steroids to regulate the fluid . levels in his body. These drugs, however, weakened his bones and he was . in hospital for a routine hip replacement. Doctors told him that, without regular medication to control his fluid levels, he would die. When he arrived at hospital for the . hip operation, nurses assured the family they would give him his . medication and said: \\'Don\\'t worry, he\\'s in good hands – we\\'ll look after . him.\\' But, despite the repeated reminders . and insistence by both Mr Gorny and his family, staff failed to give him . the tablets and he became severely dehydrated after being refused . water. In an interview with the Daily Mail in . 2010, Miss Cronin said of the nurses who treated him: \\'They were lazy, . careless and hadn\\'t bothered to check his charts and see his medication . was essential. He was totally dependent on the nurses to help him and . they totally betrayed him.\\' Yesterday Miss Cronin told the inquest . she received a distressed phone call from her son on May 27, 2009, in . which he told her he\\'d called the police because he was so desperate for . a drink. Help: Police raced to St George\\'s Hospital in Tooting, south London (pictured) but were turned away by staff . She then went to the hospital where . she found him \\'confused and angry\\', shouting at staff and behaving in an . uncharacteristically abusive manner. Despite this, one doctor asked if he . was \\'coming off the booze\\' and another asked if he was \\'always like . this\\'. Miss Cronin said: \\'He sounded really, really distressed. He said . \"\"They won\\'t give me anything to drink\"\". \\'He also said \"\"I\\'ve called the . police. You better get here quickly: they\\'re all standing around the bed . getting their stories straight\"\".\\' When Miss Cronin arrived, she . recalled: \\'They weren\\'t doing anything. They seemed out of their depth. It felt like the two locum doctors were nervous about calling anyone . more senior than them.\\' The inquest heard Mr Gorny was . restrained by security guards and sedated with strong medication to calm . him down. Later, he was put into a side room and left alone. Miss Cronin said she sat in his room . for three hours the night before he died without a single nurse checking . on him or giving him vital medicine. \\'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip.\\' Kane\\'s mother Rita Cronin . She said she told a nurse who walked . past the room that Mr Gorny had not had his medication.\\xa0 When Miss . Cronin volunteered to return to the hospital should he wake, another . nurse allegedly told her: \\'You don\\'t need to do that. If he makes noise, . I\\'ll close the door and then he won\\'t wake everyone up.\\' She added: \\'I later realised that her comment was unbelievable but I was so distraught that it didn\\'t register.\\' The morning of her son\\'s death, May . 28, 2009, Miss Cronin arrived at the hospital early to find him . delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue. She recalled: \\'I then heard three . nurses outside his room and I said: \"\"There\\'s something wrong with my . son. He doesn\\'t look right.\"\" \\'The nurse said to me \"\"He had a good night. There\\'s nothing wrong with him and he\\'s just had breakfast and a chat with us.\"\" \\'I thought: \"\"How could he have had breakfast? There\\'s no evidence (of breakfast).\"\" \\'The nurse carried on her handover then I interrupted again and said: “He\\'s not right.” \\'The other nurse then tutted and said: . \"\"She\\'s already told you he had a good night.\"\" And with that the three . of them walked off.\\' Miss Cronin said she then noticed that . her son hadn\\'t been given his medication because the packet was still . on the table by his bed. She told the locum doctor about her concerns, but the doctor said it wouldn\\'t do him any harm. A doctor doing the rounds then checked . on Mr Gorny. Miss Cronin said: \\'He took one look at him then he started . calling to everyone “Get in there quickly”. \\'It suddenly dawned on me he hasn\\'t . had his medication, hasn\\'t had his bloods done, nobody\\'s given him a . drink, nobody\\'s bothered to put his drip back on him. \\'Nobody\\'s done anything since yesterday afternoon when he became aggressive.\\' She said there was a \\'flurry of . activity\\' and everyone \\'had a very sad look on their face\\' as they . battled to save her son\\'s life. Miss Cronin said: \\'The main doctor came . out and you could tell he was really angry. He said: “You need to go and . see your son. He\\'s dying.” The couple then found their son lying . in blood and fluid-soaked sheets and a nurse came in and asked them to . help her to change them. The same nurse later came into the matron\\'s . office and asked whether they were \\'finished\\', adding: \\'Can I bag him . up?\\' The death certificate said Mr Gorny died of a \\'water deficit\\' and \\'hypernatraemia\\' – a medical term for dehydration. Mr Gorny had radiotherapy and . chemotherapy following his diagnosis of brain cancer. He was eventually . given the all-clear and led a normal life until his mother noticed he . was having trouble with his hip. As he waited for the surgery, his life started to return to normal. \\'He was out and about like everybody else,\\' said Miss Cronin yesterday. \\'I always used to make him take his . tablets for the next morning, just in case he stayed at a friend\\'s house . – and he knew the importance of his medication. We all did. \\'He was starting to enjoy his life . again, even though he had pains in his hip. He was upset he was having a . hip replacement - he was worried he would be in a wheelchair when he . was 50.\\' Nurses at the hospital were said to have been offered counselling as a result of Mr Gorny\\'s death.

At the time of his departure from the rival network, it was said he would be working with NBC Sports, and would appear on Today only to do sports-related segments. This morning however, Elliott looked very comfortable filling in, bringing in some of the banter and humor that he used to help GMA topple Today in the ratings race starting back in April of 2012, after the show\\'s 16 year run as the most watched morning news program. Thrilled: Elliott shared his excitement about hosting the morning news program on Twitter today .

Prosecutors say they were involved in rigging millions of dollars worth of city contracts and extorting city contractors. The jury panel will be whittled from a pool of more than 200 potential candidates. All four men have maintained their innocence. Their attorneys were not immediately available for comment. Ex-Detroit mayor got free trips from pension fund broker, feds say . Prosecutors say the defendants were \"\"working together to abuse Kilpatrick\\'s public offices, both his position as a state representative as well as his position of mayor of Detroit, to unjustly enrich themselves through a pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud.\"\" At the heart of the scheme was corruption in municipal contracting, mostly centering on the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, said Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.

In September 2008, the ex-mayor pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair.

He lifted one wall of the crate and Bobo slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. That also happened to be the direction where our tech expert John had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. It was an incredible sight and a great shot. Read more: \\'We knew this was going to be a trip like no other\\' I was actually a bit nervous seeing Bobo look at us. FZS Indonesia Director Peter Pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. Sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable. We had no idea what to expect. Did we make him feel threatened? Would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras? Luckily for us, the answer was no. He turned away from us and walked into the jungle. The islands of Sumatra and Borneo are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. It\\'s illegal to have one as a pet because it\\'s an endangered species, but they\\'re sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. Pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. It\\'s a brutal process. Mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. It\\'s a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years. Most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. That\\'s exactly what happened to Bobo. He was five years old when his owner gave him up. Bobo was then brought to Peter Pratje and his team at the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Read more: Why you should care about the Sumatran rainforest . When the FZS obtains a former pet orangutan like Bobo, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity. So the FZS team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior. It takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would\\'ve taught her baby. Each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree. Climbing is very important for Sumatran orangutans. They share the same habitat as Sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger\\'s dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. After Bobo left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform Peter and his team had constructed. But he didn\\'t. Frustratingly, Bobo wasn\\'t using his training. He remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. Read more: Orangutans stressed by eco-tourists . After a release, members of the FZS orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day for until they\\'re sure the orangutan can survive on its own. Several members of the team were following Bobo that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit. Nothing worked. Minutes ticked by. Finally, Peter theorized that Bobo was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. Bobo has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. We didn\\'t want to hurt Bobo\\'s chances of survival, so we decided to leave him and the FZS trackers to go about their day. It was too early to tell how Bobo will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. We would have to wait and get an update from Peter later. Walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of Sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide. If this species can be brought back from the brink of extinction, could this be a model for other species?\",\"Jenni Watts produced Expedition: Sumatra, CNN\\'s new environment special .\\nThe team traveled round Indonesia charting some of the biggest issues affecting the country .\\nThey visited an orangutan conservation group trying to protect the endangered species .\"\\n0064cb4483aea62ced1d8ed67c8129497bb303cb,\"(CNN) -- Most of us have a favorite toy from childhood that still has the power to make us smile, whether it\\'s a Barbie doll, a Micro Machine or the board game Operation. What makes them memorable is the subject of a new book, \"\"Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos,\"\" a collection of some of the most beloved toys of the 20th century. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as \"\"a catalyst for the imagination,\"\" Byrne said. Most of our favorite toys came into our lives when we were developing our identity and figuring out the world, he said. Some, like the rampaging dinosaur King Zor (1962), have faded from the cultural landscape, while others, like View-Master and Nok Hockey (which both hit the mass market in the 1940s), have been passed down through generations. The toys that stick with us are those that allowed us to explore new worlds and create experiences. \"\"Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination,\"\" said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. \"\"What makes each Barbie doll unique is how a little girl creates and projects her sense of self and her fantasies onto that piece of plastic.\"\" Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal. \"\"Some, just by looking at them, reflect the design sensibility of the time, becoming almost works of art,\"\" he said. \"\"We identify with them in the cultural context of their time.\"\" So, how can you tell if a toy will be a hit for your child? When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you\\'re shopping for, Byrne said. \"\"The hot toys are only hot if they\\'re hot for your child,\"\" he said. \"\"The toys that become memorable are the ones that connect with our interests.\"\"\",\"New book \"\"Toy Time\"\" looks back at memorable toys of the 20th century .\\nThe crowd-sourced list includes toys such as View-Master and Nok Hockey .\\nMore recent selections include POGS and Trolls .\"\\n006652b4ba431e44baec92d84fe62c4727983642,\"By . James Slack . Last updated at 4:09 PM on 18th November 2011 . In a damning indictment of community policing, one in four people has never seen a bobby walking the beat. Despite millions of pounds being poured into making the forces of law and order more visible, the streets are still too often devoid of that reassuring presence. Even the ‘Blunkett bobbies’ designed for just that purpose are seen infrequently. Damning indictment of community policing: The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency . High visibility: The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training civilian staff to become PCSOs . The disturbing findings were uncovered in a survey of almost 50,000 by the Home Office. The British Crime Survey discovered that 55 per cent of the public had seen police officers or police community support officers walking the beat at least once a month. But this fell to one in seven, or 14 per cent, when they were asked if they see officers on a daily basis. And 25 per cent said they had not at any stage seen either a fully-fledged police officer or PCSO on the beat. PCSOs, introduced by David Blunkett when he was Home Secretary, are supposed to spend the bulk of their time pounding the streets. The Home Office spent hundreds of millions of pounds on recruiting and training the civilian staff, who do not have proper police powers and cannot make arrests. The revelations will reignite controversy about police efficiency. One . of the most common demands from members of the public is for more . officers on the beat to provide reassurance that they are being . protected from thugs and burglars. But . Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary said recently that fewer . than one in ten uniformed officers in some forces are available to man . the front line at any one time. Police . spending almost doubled, from £7.72billion in 1998/1999 to . £14.55billion a decade later. The number of officers increased from . 124,756 in March 1998, to a peak of around 141,000. Pioneering: David Blunkett introduced PCSOs when he was Home Secretary . But, while officer numbers were increasing dramatically, the proportion of time an officer actually spends on patrol fell, from 15.3 per cent to 13.8 per cent. Police budgets are being cut as part of the Government’s austerity measures – with forces threatening to axe around 16,000 police officers. Last night Roy Rudham, chairman of the UK Neighbourhood Watch Trust, said: ‘It has always been a concern of people that they do not see police officers on the street and with the cuts being implemented the likelihood is they will see even fewer officers. ‘That will especially be the case if crime goes up and police resources are stretched to the absolute limit.’ The Home Office survey also found that only half of the public – 52 per cent – were confident that the authorities were effective at reducing anti-social behaviour. And just 41 per cent felt the authorities were effective in bringing louts to justice. The situation on police visibility has . improved. In 2006, four out of ten people said they had never witnessed . a police officer or PCSO on the streets. But it will be considered poor progress for the massive investment in extra police and PCSOs. The . survey also found that only 4 per cent had used the online crime maps . introduced by the Home Office to give people a greater idea of crime . levels on their street and to increase police accountability. When the maps were launched at the start of this year, the website crashed – apparently due to high demand. In its report, Her Majesty’s . Inspectorate of Constabulary found that there are more officers on duty . on a Monday morning than at any other time of the week – and the fewest . just after midnight on Friday when drunken violence soars. Antiquated shift patterns, court . hearings and training requirements mean that in two forces – . Bedfordshire and Devon and Cornwall – only 9 per cent of officers can . actually tackle crime, it said. The . watchdog found many other forces fared little better, with an average . of 12 per cent of officers available to catch crooks and keep people . safe. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Denis O’Connor also highlighted how one in three members of the police workforce is not employed in a front-line role. These include staff working in personnel, maintenance and administration. HMIC is predicting the loss of 16,100 officers by 2015, along with up to 1,800 community support\\xa0 officers and 16,100 civilian staff, because of budget cuts. But it says there is so much waste that £1billion – the equivalent of a 12 per cent cut in government funding – could be axed without any reduction in police availability. This would be achieved by getting police out from behind their desks. Critics say repeated promises by Labour to cut red tape failed to deliver. Police Minister Nick Herbert said: ‘We know the public want their local police to be visible and responsive to their concerns. And the police want to be out in their local communities stopping crime, catching criminals and helping victims. ‘That’s why we have swept away central targets and red tape to free up more officers for the frontline.’\",\"Findings uncovered in Home Office survey of 50,000 .\\nOnly 14 per cent see officers on daily basis .\\nResults in spite of PCSO \\'Blunkett bobbies\\' introduced to boost police visibility .\"\\n006684f2e2fa98b707502c549ab1a0ea0d22a3db,\"Gordon Brown gave Labour rising star Chuka Umunna ‘the hairdryer treatment’ in a blistering phone call after the shadow business secretary publicly blamed him for Labour’s struggles on the economy. Mr Brown attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former Labour leader’s failure to confront Britain’s ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election. Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to even talk about Government ‘cuts’ was still costing Labour support, because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit. Labour are currently 25 points behind the Tories on which party is best for the economy. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (left) and Gordon Brown (right) clashed on the phone over Labour\\'s record on the economy . But the remarks sparked a furious response from Mr Brown, MailOnline has learnt. The former Prime Minister told Mr Umunna that he should not accept Tory claims that Labour was spending too much before the last general election, a senior Labour source revealed. The source said: ‘He still cannot accept Labour was running a structural deficit. Even after all this time he won’t accept that he was wrong – it’s unbelievable.’ The deficit – the difference between Government spending and how much it raises in taxes each year – was more than £160 billion in 2010. Labour blamed the huge borrowing splurge on the global recession – because the Government was forced to withstand a huge hit on tax revenue as people lost their jobs, while at the same time increasing spending on benefits. But analysis has since revealed that the ‘structural deficit’ – the amount of borrowing needed even when the economy is growing normally – had grown to more than £100 billion in the last year of the Labour government. In an interview with GQ magazine, published this month, Mr Umunna said Mr Brown’s refusal to face up to the deficit was still hurting the Labour Party. He said: ‘My view is that the seeds were sown under the last government and Gordon - for whom I have a lot of respect - his refusal to use the word “cuts” in trying to frame the economic debate as investment versus cuts gave the impression we didn\\'t understand that debt and deficit would have to be dealt with.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) and the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right), who were both Treasury aides under Gordon Brown, have defended the party\\'s record controlling Government spending . A source close to Mr Umunna confirmed the pair spoke in a telephone call after the interview was published earlier this month. The source said: ‘It is something they disagree on. ‘Chuka’s argument has always been that pursuing the line that it was Labour spending versus Tory cuts allowed Osborne to make the whole election debate about deficit reduction. They spoke and that is definitely still his view.’ A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: \\'Chuka and Gordon are both members of the PLP - or course they speak to each other on a range of issues. Chuka has great respect for Gordon.\\' It is understood that on this occasion Mr Umunna initiated the call. Conservative MP Henry Smith said the confrontation between Mr Brown and Mr Umunna revealed a \\'divided\\' Labour Party. He said: \\'This shows a Labour party still in denial about the record deficit they left behind and with no plan to deal with our debts and ensure a more financially secure future for Britain. \\'Brown’s intervention begs the question who’s in charge of a clearly split and infighting Labour leadership team.\\'\",\"EXCLUSIVE: Source reveals extraordinary call by ex Prime Minister .\\nMr Umunna blamed former PM for Labour\\'s economic credibility problem .\\nHe said Mr Brown \\'gave impression we didn\\'t understand debt and deficit\\'\\nFormer Labour leader confronted Mr Umunna in an angry call afterwards .\"\\n0066b77d259f645ce9226011d4aa13121a8ac57b,\"By . Kieran Corcoran . A British TV producer was killed in Qatar when a speeding motorcyclist hit her while racing a friend at high speed. Kerry Rome, 33, moved to Qatar to work for TV news station Al-Jazeera, and had been out with colleagues before being knocked down as she crossed the road at 2am, an inquest heard. She was the TV station\\'s first female technical director, and moved to the Middle East for work with her husband Mark Harris, 35. Killed: Kerry Rome, pictured, was knocked down and killed by a motorcyclist in Qatar in 2012 . Police initially believed Mrs Rome\\'s death was accidental - but it later emerged that the motorbike rider had no driving licence, and was racing a friend when he hit Mrs Rome on April 20, 2012. A 21-year-old man was convicted of killing Kerry in a Qatari court in 2012 with a judge describing his speed as \\'excessive\\'. An inquest in Stamford, Lincolnshire, heard that the biker hit Mrs Rome - who had just stepped out into the road - while trying to under-take his rival. Moments after stepping into the road she was struck by the motorcyclist as he attempted to under-take his friend. Giving evidence, Mrs Rome\\'s mother Margaret, 62, described the moment she found out about her daughter’s death as \\'the worst phone call of my life\\'. She added: \\'My lovely daughter Kerry would be here today if that reckless, dangerous motorcyclist had not been racing with a friend at 2am\\'. Mr Harris also paid tribute to his late wife, whom he had married just months before her death in an Elvis-themed Las Vegas wedding. \\'Excessive\\': The motorcyclist was undertaking his rival in a street race when he hit Mrs Rome. A Qatari court convicted him of the killing . Mark, originally from Market Deeping Lincolnshire, said: \\'Kerry was an amazing person. She was kind, generous, there to help and never had a bad word to say about anyone. \\'We were career-oriented adults who relocated abroad to make a good life and good careers for ourselves. \\'This was all taken away by a man who was out racing a motorbike with his friends.\\' A toxicology report carried out in Qatar found 296mg of alcohol per 100ml in Kerry’s blood, around three-and-a-half times the British drink-drive limit. Three of Mrs Rome\\'s colleagues told the hearing she did not appear drunk on the night she died. Oliver Walker said: \\'We had a few drinks but nothing major as we were dancing close to the stage. It’s not like we were pounding shots at the bar\\'. South Lincolnshire coroner Professor Robert Forrest said: \\'It had appeared that the motorcyclist was undertaking one of his companions when the collision took place.\\' Middle East: Mrs Rome moved to Qatar for work with her husband Mark Harris . He added that there was insufficient evidence to produce a verdict of unlawful killing, instead recording the incident as a death caused as a result of a road traffic collision. A friend of the family said today: \\'The family are obviously disappointed that the coroner effectively delivered a verdict of accidental death. \\'It is the family’s position that Kerry was not killed in an accident. The motorcyclist hit her during an illegal road race. \\'If he had not been taking part in an illegal activity Kerry would still be here today.\\' Kerry and her husband Mark moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008 when she became the first female technical director of live news at Al Jazeera English. They then transferred to Doha in October 2011 when Kerry was promoted to Al Jazeera English’s head office. Speaking after the inquest, her mother said: \\'She was such a vivacious person and so full of life. Considering how young she was she has done so much in her life. \\'When we went out there and saw what life was like we realised how strong a person she was. We are all so incredibly proud of her and what she did.\\' Kirsty Rome, her sister, added: \\'We were all really close, she loved her family.

Apple . staff have been \\'banned\\' from holidays in the first two weeks of . October in America, and tech insiders expect products from the launch to . appear in stores shortly after - probably on October 14. All the signs now point towards an early October launch for the gadgets. Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4. The event will be his first big product introduction . \\'Having . seen first-hand how Apple packs its staff inside its stores for iPhone . launches does suggest that whatever new product they announce\\xa0 is . imminent,\\' says Luke Peters, editor of T3.

The idea that there are two models - one sporting the fast A5 processor inside iPad 2, and a cheaper model with lower-tech components, seems likely. Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to \\'the new iPhones released next month.\\' This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late in October.

He is also an adviser to the United States Army for diversity and cultural affairs. Al Vivian says Eric Holder was right to urge Americans to confront diversity issues now. FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African-American male and I am privileged. Not on race; but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed. As a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post-September 11 profiling. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others . Recently Attorney General Eric Holder made some statements concerning America\\'s need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in cross-racial dialogue. Holder\\'s comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race. On confronting our history he said: . \"\"To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. ... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. \"\" Concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined: \"\"If we are to make progress in this area, we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us.\"\" In a recent interview, President Obama responded by saying, America has made \"\"enormous progress, and we shouldn\\'t lose sight of that ... I think it\\'s fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.\"\" The president went on to say, \"\"I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here.\"\" They were both right; but they were addressing two different things. Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions. Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions. Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation\\'s human capital. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half-truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others. Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate a White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. This privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we\\'re teaching ideology. And if you\\'re a person of color, you\\'re excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: \"\"When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing.\"\" It\\'s impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups\\' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month. It\\'s like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters. What\\'s missing is what the late Paul Harvey would have called \"\"the rest of the story.\"\" George Washington Carver, a black man, had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut. His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context. The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut. George Washington Carver revitalized the agricultural south; thus the financial south. He saved the south. But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was a tremendous invention. However its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time, until a black man named Lewis Latimer contributed his invention, the carbon filament, to the project, making possible the widespread use of electric light. Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison. But most history books have no mention of Latimer. Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776. Great nation, strong republic, yes! Democracy, no. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people. To deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half-truths with reputably documented facts, our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history. We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot only talk. We must also listen. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism.

Alway was dismissed of more than a dozen other counts under a plea agreement. Some of those counts were resisting an officer, possession of a controlled substance, and receiving stolen property. The Desert Sun reports that Alway has been in custody since last year at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility on $150,000 bail. The ANTM finalist was arrested on June 28 in 2013 for investigation of burglary, fraud, narcotics possession, committing a felony while on bail and other charges, the Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement at the time of the arrest. Officers responding to a report of a suspicious woman walking around a neighborhood spotted a condominium with an open back door, police said. Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said. Authorities believed an armed man also was in the condo and the SWAT team was called in for the ensuing six-hour standoff.

She and her husband spent a week on the petite island in February, relaxing and enjoying each other\\'s company, with no one else around but the resident birds. \"\"I was looking for a rental that would be private so that came up as I was searching around and we were like, well it can\\'t get much more private than that,\"\" said Hyde, 43, a stay-at-home mom who lives in Woodbridge, Virginia. \"\"It\\'s not an exclusive sort of thing. We\\'re just ordinary people who just did something cool.\"\" Indeed, the idea of renting a private island usually conjures up images of multimillionaires spending a fortune to jet off to a tropical paradise in the Caribbean or the South Pacific. If you have a lot of money to shell out, the possibilities are endless. But while a big budget will give you more options and luxurious accommodations, you don\\'t have to be rich to rent your own island for a vacation. It can sometimes take as little as a few hundred dollars a week, a sense of adventure and the willingness to look at locations closer to home. The island mystique . Pretty Joe Rock, for example, can be yours for under $3,000 a week, which includes the use of a boat to get you to and from the island. Owner Bob Rainek said he gets a broad spectrum of renters, from blue collar to white collar; from families with kids to couples. \"\"It\\'s almost a universal thing that people have this romantic kind of feeling for islands,\"\" Rainek said. \"\"It\\'s a mystique to be on your own private island, to have water 360 degrees [around you.] It\\'s a primal type emotion, as I look at it.\"\" Business has been brisk despite the economy, partly because people who might otherwise go to Mexico for a vacation have been scared off by that country\\'s drug-related violence and are looking for something exotic closer to home, Rainek said. He was proud to tout the Florida Keys, which he called \"\"America\\'s Caribbean,\"\" as an alternative. Some of the most popular places to rent islands may surprise you. They include the northern United States and Canada, said Chris Krolow, the CEO of Private Islands Inc., a company based in Toronto, Ontario, that has about 200 islands for rent all over the world in its database. Clients come from all walks of life, spending as little as $550 for a week on Republic Island in Michigan (which comes with a log cabin) or more than $66,000 for a week on The Rania Experience in the Maldives (which comes with three villas, a private chef, a yacht and other ultra-luxurious touches.) \\'Robinson Crusoe\\' experience . For something in between, a budget of several thousand dollars a week is usually a good start. \"\"We\\'re even finding more and more people who are saving and planning a honeymoon on an island. It\\'s a little bit more expensive than what they had originally planned but it seems to be a growing trend,\"\" Krolow said. \"\"It\\'s probably the most romantic experience that you could ever imagine just being on this tiny island with the person that you just married.\"\" You can choose a self-catering island, which gives you the use of a home but requires you to bring your own food and make your own meals (the less expensive option), or a full-service island that comes with a staff, according to Vladi Private Islands, a company based in Hamburg, Germany. Its database of about 150 islands for rent includes everything from Île de Chantemesle near Paris, France, to Forsyth Island, New Zealand. Some people seek the thrill of being dropped off in a remote place that\\'s completely undeveloped. On \"\"Robinson Crusoe\"\" islands, you are left to your own devices, make your own meals, bring a tent or hammock and anything else you may need, the company said. Nova Scotia, Canada, is one part of the world that offers such opportunities, added Sabine Rollinger, a Vladi spokeswoman. Krolow recalled a CEO who last year spent 10 days on a deserted spot in the Marshall Islands bonding with his 13-year-old son. \"\"It\\'s pretty much the closest you\\'ll get to being stranded on your own private island,\"\" Krolow said. Spending a lot or a little . On the other end of the spectrum, there\\'s Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson\\'s 74-acre paradise in the British Virgin Islands complete with luxurious accommodations and a large staff. It\\'s all yours for at least $53,000 a night for up to 28 guests, though you can rent individual rooms for a fraction of that price during a select few \"\"Celebration Weeks.\"\" YouTube: See what $53,000 a day gets you on Necker Island . It may sound like the ultimate getaway, but people who are looking for that private island feel might be a little disappointed by such a huge resort, Krolow said. And if the idea of having an island all too yourself is too expensive or intimidating, you can try one with a single lodge or hotel perched on top, like the quaint five-room bed-and-breakfast on East Brother Light Station near San Francisco, California. Starting at about $300 a night, it\\'s an island stay that\\'s both private and not too hard on the wallet.

A bird\\'s eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris. The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others. On Friday three people remained hospitalized -- two in critical condition, one in serious condition. The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. A source said the workers were testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo, which is a spaceship being built for Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson\\'s space tourism company. \"\"We were doing a test that we believed was completely safe. ... We don\\'t know why it exploded,\"\" said Rutan, who was not at the site at the time of the accident.  Watch the aftermath of the explosion » . The explosion happened during a \"\"cold fire test,\"\" he said. A spokeswoman for the space port, which is about 80 miles north of Los Angeles, said the blast was on a remote pad and that the area had been contained. Aerial video of the blast aftermath showed a charred and twisted flatbed trailer attached to a truck cab with a large silver tank next to it. Large pieces of debris appeared to be strewn for hundreds of yards from the center. Rutan won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 for the first repeat sub-orbital space flight with his pioneering SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipTwo is a small carbon fiber craft designed to carry seven passengers up to 65 miles above the earth, traveling at a speed of about 12,000 mph. A ticket for such a ride was expected to cost $200,000. Entering the edge of space those on board will experience weightlessness for about 15 minutes before beginning the journey back to earth. \"\"What we\\'re trying to do is make space travel affordable and fun.

Associated Press . A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player\\'s teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing for Bassel Saad, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of referee John Bieniewicz. The 44-year-old referee \\'did not see the punch coming,\\' said Saleh, who played for Saad\\'s team during the over-30 men\\'s league game at Mies Park in Livonia on June 29. Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at a local hospital, had a wife and two sons. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Livonia, Michigan. Saad is charged with second-degree murder in the death of soccer referee John Bieniewicz . John Bieniewicz (pictured), who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area, died on July 1 . Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to eject Saad from the game. The punch, which Saleh said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to \\'fall back without any control of his body.\\' Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonia, Michigan . In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That\\'s when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: \\'Wake up, buddy. You\\'re going to be OK.\\' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle. A man who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area has died. John Bieniewicz, who was attacked on Sunday at a park in Livonia, Michigan died at Detroit Receiving Hospital on Tuesday, said hospital spokesman Alton Gunn . Saad, a 36-year-old auto mechanic from Dearborn, had been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm before Bieniewicz died on July 1. That charge was formally dropped, and prosecutors issued the murder charge. The probable-cause hearing in Livonia District Court, which will determine whether to send the case to trial, resumed today. It ended with Judge Kathleen McCann denying prosecutors\\' motion to bring up an alleged 2005 incident in which Saad is said to have been involved in an altercation with another player at a soccer game. Defense lawyer Ali Hammoud said his client\\'s past has nothing to do with this case, and prosecutors\\' interest in bringing it up shows that \\'their case is extremely weak on second-degree murder.\\'\",\"Bassel Saad, 36, charged with second-degree murder in Livonia, Michigan for the fatal punch on June 29 .\\nSaad allegedly punched referee John Bieniewicz after being told he was being ejected from game .\\nBieniewicz, a 44-year-old dialysis tech at a local hospital, was a married father-of-two .\"\\n006bca7d18b3c6889ce567133566d22e491d27c1,\"Earlier this season I picked Thierry Henry as my greatest-ever Premier League striker.

His business, the sale of products for growing and processing marijuana, has always been in a legal limbo in Uruguay, his country. Legally speaking, it\\'s a complicated and risky situation. Selling accessories for the cultivation of cannabis is legal, but the production, sale and distribution of marijuana are not. \"\"It would be fantastic,\"\" Palese says, \"\"if we could also have access to the market of consumers.\"\" The dream of the Montevideo resident is about to come true. The Uruguayan Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small South American country the first in Latin America to legalize marijuana. The bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in July with 50 out of 96 votes. It also has the support of President Jose Mujica. The bill has generated international headlines because, if approved, the Uruguayan government would have the authority to regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. The legislation also has the support of the Broad Front, Mujica\\'s party. Approval is widely expected. \"\"More than anything, it\\'s going to give me peace about growing what I like, which is marijuana. That\\'s what I like to consume. It would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal,\"\" Palese says. The bill rests on the premise that if \"\"the state assumes the control and regulation of the activities of importation and exportation, sowing, growing, harvesting, producing ... storing, commercializing and distributing,\"\" then the ills of drug trafficking would be greatly reduced and the quality of the plants improved, benefiting patients and putting drug traffickers out of business. The bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grams for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor\\'s prescription.  Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies. But many in the traditionally Catholic country of 3.3 million people feel legislators are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons. Alfredo Solari, an opposition senator from the Colorado Party, says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction. \"\"It\\'s a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market. There will be a legal market that can be accessed by most Uruguayans. But there will also be a parallel illegal market for all of those who can\\'t get marijuana legally,\"\" Solari said. Proponents of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention, and advertising of cannabis in any form would be strictly forbidden. Luis Gallo, a senator with the Broad Front Party, which supports the bill, said current drug policy, which rests solely on law enforcement and prohibition, has produced no results. \"\"This is about regulating drugs. It\\'s doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s a free-for-all, but it doesn\\'t mean prohibition either. It means regulation has to work to reduce the risks and harmful effects of drug consumption,\"\" Gallo said. In an interview with CNN en Espanol, Mujica suggested in September that when it comes to drug trafficking, the trafficking part is usually more harmful than the drug itself, especially when it comes to marijuana. \"\"We would like to identify those who consume (marijuana), take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume (the drug) so that they don\\'t have to depend on drug traffickers. We want to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them,\"\" Mujica said. Supporters of the bill launched a national campaign called \"\"Responsible Regulation.\"\" The campaign produced public service announcements in which a doctor, a mother and an attorney suggest it makes sense for Uruguayans to support the law. Once the bill gains approval, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations to implement the law.\",\"Bill to legalize pot widely expected to pass in Tuesday vote .\\nIt would give Uruguayan government authority to regulate production and distribution .\\nSupporters say it will put drug traffickers out of business .\\nOpponents say it\\'s dangerous because it will make more marijuana available .\"\\n006e02fe8bb2b880c9ac1c2547dcaca5bff57263,\"Australia\\'s Attorney General George Brandis was left red faced after he got sunburnt at the G20 summit this weekend after forgetting to slip, slop, slap.

Marshall Jensen of Utah, was one of 30 leukemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at Penn Medicine recently, in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of HIV programmed to target and kill cancer. The 30-year-old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer-free for the first time in years. Scroll down for video . Cancer free: Marshall Jensen\\'s (right) leukemia is in remission after receiving a breakthrough cancer treatment that involved the HIV virus. Pictured above with wife Amanda (left) and their son Kezman (center) The 30-year-old Utah man was one of 30 patients in an experimental trial, who received doses of the deactivated HIV virus, which act as cancer killing fighters in the body. Of those who underwent of the treatment, 23 are still alive and 19 are now in remission . Jensen, wife Amanda and their young son Kezman have been travelling the country ever since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012, just one year after their marriage, searching for an effective treatment for his cancer. \\'They were a young couple. They weren’t married very long. They had a brand new little baby when all of this started,\\' neighbor Lindsay Wright told KSL. The Jensens didn\\'t find success though until they met Dr Carl June at Penn Medicine. Dr June and his team of physicians have spent two decades working on a breakthrough experimental treatment using the HIV virus. On Thursday, Jensen was welcomed back to his Utah neighborhood, after travelling the U.S. these past two years for treatment . Jensen (center) and his wife Amanda (left) are pictured above with Dr Carl June, who led the gene therapy trial at Penn Medicine . \\'We were calling it our Hail Mary pass,\\' Marshall Jensen said. \\'It felt right. … We didn\\'t know how we were going to get out there, what we were going to do, but it worked. By God\\'s grace I was able to come back.\\' On Thursday, a healthier Jensen returned to his neighborhood in Utah to a surprise homecoming celebration. The connection between leukemia and HIV was first discovered in 2006, when an HIV-positive man named Timothy Ray Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation, Brown\\'s cancer went into remission and the HIV disappeared from his system making him the first man to ever be fully cured of the virus. Dr June is now looking to use the treatment to combat other types of cancer. Jensen (right) pictured above with his wife (left) and their son (center) Since then, Dr June and his team have been working vigilantly on developing a HIV-based treatment for leukemia and this October, published a study showing the therapy\\'s success on 30 cancer patients. The patients who received the treatment had billions of T-cells extracted from their body, which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated HIV. The \\'serial killer\\' cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer, and remain dormant until the cancer reappears. While the idea of receiving a dose of HIV may seem scary to some, Dr June says there\\'s nothing to fear about the stripped-down virus used in the treatment. \\'It\\'s a disabled virus, but it retains the one essential feature of HIV, which is the ability to insert new genes into cells,\\' Dr June explained. Of the 30 leukemia patients who received the treatment, comprised of five adults and 25 children, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission. Seven-year-old Emma Whitehead was the first child to receive the treatment in 2012, and has been cancer-free for two years now. Dr June and his team are now looking at using the HIV treatment to attack other forms of cancers, and will be starting trials this summer for pancreatic cancer patients.

Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to \\'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping\\'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has \\'annoyed\\' all of the residents at The Villas .

Emily Allen . Last updated at 6:33 PM on 7th September 2011 . Anthony Lloyd, 17, was found by police with his pockets \\'bulging\\' with stolen cigarettes and jewellery . A teenage looter who took part in the Manchester riots lied in court about being an Olympic hopeful in a bid to avoid jail. Anthony Lloyd, 17, who was caught with pockets bulging with jewellery and cigarettes during the riots in Manchester on August 9, was jailed for eight months yesterday. But now he could now be hauled back into the dock after falsely claiming he was a member of the British judo team in a desperate plea for leniency. A letter was even presented to the judge at Manchester Magistrates Court backing up the claim. Lloyd had managed to convince his unwitting legal team he was a promising judo star. His defence lawyer Estelle Parkhouse told the court: \\'A custodial sentence would impair his prospects with the squad and being part of the Olympics.\\' But it has been discovered Lloyd has never performed for Great Britain at any level. Bosses at the British Judo Association said that while he is a member of a local club he is \\'a million miles away\\' from being anywhere near the national squad. A spokesman said: \\'Mr Lloyd has never represented us at any level and it\\'s wrong for anyone to describe him as an Olympic hopeful. \\'He represents a club but has never been in any GB trials or anywhere near any of our squads.\\' It is understood the case could now be re-opened if the court feels it has been misled.\\xa0 Lloyd may now face further charges of perjury should judges decide to bring him back into the dock. Loyd was sentenced to eight months\\' detention and training for each count, to serve concurrently at Manchester Youth Court . He could also be hauled before Crown Court if the offence is considered serious enough. Lloyd, of Audenshaw, was stopped by police at 9.30pm at the height of the rioting in Manchester. Officers found him carrying £66 worth of cigarettes stolen from a looted newsagents and a collection of costume jewellery which he said he had picked up off the floor. During the case Lloyd\\'s lawyer Estelle Parkhouse said Lloyd was part of the British Judo team . and was returning from training that Tuesday night when he heard about . the disorder and ventured into the city centre. She said he took jewellery that he had seen on the street and knew it had been stolen. She said it was his intention to give it to his girlfriend. Lloyd\\'s parents and brother were in court to hear District Judge Jonathan Taaffe describe the case as \\'most tragic\\'. The judge said he accepted Lloyd had led a \\'blameless existence\\' and had \\'an excellent future and was a talented sportsman\\'. But after reading glowing references the judge told him: \\'It is my duty to impose a custodial sentence in this matter. \\'The public have to be aware that people who choose to become involved in large scale public disorder, rioting and looting, will be severely punished. \\'On this night the centre of Manchester and Salford resembled a battlefield and the public throughout the country were shocked and sickened by what they saw.\\' Lloyd, who burst into tears as the sentence was read out, said he had been stupid and had gone into the city out of curiosity. After the hearing Ms Parkhouse issued a statement on his behalf, saying: \\'I am sincerely remorseful for my actions and would do anything to give back to the community what I have taken from them.\\' It is understood attempts to check the bogus claim were made by the defence team. But they were unable to contact the GB team as they were in action abroad.

Manuel Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, is also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Kelly Thomas, 37. Ramos\\' family and friends raised the $100,000 for the bond -- which typically is 10% of the bail -- to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County sheriff. Ramos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. \"\"By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it\\'s that late in the morning,\"\" Amormino told CNN. Thomas\\' father, Ron, 55, of Cypress, California, objected to Ramos\\' release and said Ramos should have been held without bail. \"\"I don\\'t want him released because he brutally murdered my son,\"\" said Thomas, who\\'s a safety consultant for the construction industry. He was an Army Ranger in special ops for 10 years; a martial arts master, he now teaches hand-to-hand combat to Marines going to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Also charged in the Thomas case is Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. He was released last week on $25,000 bail. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men are among six Fullerton police officers -- all men -- who were involved in the Thomas arrest and have been placed on involuntary, paid administrative leave. The FBI is also investigating the incident for civil rights violations. Ron Thomas, the father, said Thursday he wants criminal charges against each of the other four officers. \"\"Even if he just stood there and did absolutely nothing, that\\'s what he should be charged with. He didn\\'t prevent my son\\'s death,\"\" Thomas said. The Orange County district attorney\\'s office said this month that no charges were filed against the other four because \"\"the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers.\"\" Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation July 5 and died five days later. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Since then, two other allegations of brutality at the hands of city police have surfaced, both regarding unrelated arrests in 2010. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and fellow prosecutors viewed 16 minutes of bus depot surveillance video showing what happened in the Thomas case, Rackauckas has said. Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, the prosecutor\\'s office said. The Orange County coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Ramos had made initial contact with Thomas -- whom he knew as a \"\"homeless drifter\"\" -- after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars, Rackauckas said. \"\"He lifted his fists to Kelly Thomas and he said, \\'You see my fist? Now they\\'re getting to ready to F you up,\\' \"\" Rackauckas said, using \"\"F\"\" instead of the full profanity. The district attorney said Ramos\\' conduct was unacceptable and \"\"not protecting and serving\"\" the public. \"\"Ramos had to know that he was creating a situation where Kelly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to \\'F him up,\\'\"\" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Taser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers. At that point, Thomas was making no audible sounds, indicating that he was \"\"down and seriously injured,\"\" the prosecutor\\'s office said.

The pain is easing, but it\\'s a nagging ache just the same. The rush-hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. It was March 11, 2004, during morning rush hour, that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines, unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. The attacks are the deadliest in Europe since the rise of al Qaeda. More than a year later on July 7, 2005, terrorists would stage bombings on the London transit system that killed 52 people and wounded hundreds more. The explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks -- sometimes placed under seats -- court documents say. The terrorists got off at various stations down the line, before cell-phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations. Police dismantled another bomb that didn\\'t explode. It provided vital clues that led to arrests. Eighteen people, mostly Islamic militants, have been convicted in the attacks. Watch more on the anniversary . Juan Carlos Garcia, an engineer who took the train later that same day, said he knows a couple whose daughter died in the attacks. \"\"It was very tough, especially knowing it could have been you,\"\" Garcia said. \"\"Now, you remember it, but not the same as when it just happened.\"\" Beata Sadecka, a regular commuter, says she rides cautiously. \"\"Every day, when I get on the train, I always ride in the last car,\"\" Sadecka said. \"\"I don\\'t know why, for safety,\"\" she added, not quite sure of her motives. On one train, the first explosion was in a rear car and, as people ran forward to get away, they were hit by explosions in the middle cars, investigators have said. \"\"People remember the March 11th attacks,\"\" said Vicente Jimenez, a deputy editor with El Pais newspaper, \"\"and while conscious that the threat continues, you have to continue with your life.\"\" Memorial observations were scheduled throughout the day, including five minutes of silence for the victims. King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were not taking part in the public events. A victims group called their non-participation a slight. But on this fifth anniversary, most commuters are just going about their business, with that nagging ache still lingering.\",\"Spain commemorates fifth anniversary of Madrid train bombings .\\nMarch 11, 2004, attacks killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 .\\nExplosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks .\"\\n00724c0377fc4af3032c3d9bed712ed283917d3c,\"By .

Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef is serving a life sentence at the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing . The convicted terrorist who planned and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing - who has been in isolation for more than a decade - has filed a lawsuit to end his solitary confinement. Ramzi Yousef, 45, has been imprisoned since his capture in Pakistan in 1995 - two years after he killed six people and injured 1,000 others after detonating explosives beneath the North Tower. Since the September 11 attacks, the 45-year-old Pakistani national has . been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the . federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, known as \\'the Alcatraz of the Rockies.\\' Yousef says that despite good . behavior while behind bars, he remains in solitary solely because he is a . terrorist - which he claims is a violation of his due process rights. In . a letter to the prison\\'s warden obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Yousef says: \\'I . request an immediate end to my solitary confinement and ask to be in a . unit in an open prison environment where inmates are allowed outside . their cells for no less than 14 hours a day.\\' \\'I have been in solitary confinement in the U.S. since February 8, . 1995, with no end in sight... I further ask not to be in handcuffs or . leg irons when moved outside my cell.\\' The Times reports that Yousef doesn\\'t even see the prison\\'s guards, who push his meals through a small slot between two steel doors. The only other inmate within the sound of his voice is reportedly a man who has killed others while incarcerated. In August, Yousef\\'s attorney Bernard Kleinman said his client wanted out of solitary because he was \\'lonely\\' - and claimed that despite the World Trade Center attack, the 1994 bombing . of a Philippine jet, a plot to kill Pope John Paul II and other plots - Yousef is \\'no longer a threat.\\' Isolation: Since the September 11 attacks, Yousefl has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, which is known as \\'the Alcatraz of the Rockies\\' Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated . Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down . \\'I think it\\'s just plain unfair,\\' Kleinman said outside court at the time. \\'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.\\' Yousef was sentenced to life in prison . after he was convicted in the World Trade Center attack, as well as a plot to bomb 12 American . airliners over the Far East. At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: \\'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.\\' His uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 terror atrocities that destroyed the World Trade Center towers and left nearly 3,000 people dead. Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack . Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he\\'s lonely . He fled to the Middle East the night of the . bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was . turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a . radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said. Since . 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved . for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the . country. The restrictions prevent Yousef from . communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his . lawyer, Kleinman said.

Police are hunting the former husband of a Cheltenham woman after she was found murdered in her own home. Jane Wiggett, nee Spencer, was found dead in her flat in Whaddon, Cheltenham, on Friday. Her body was discovered after officers were called to her home and Gloustershire Police have launched a murder inquiry. Police are hunting her ex-husband Danny Spencer, who they wish to arrest in connection with Ms Wiggett\\'s death. Mr Spencer, 57, is well known in the area, according to police, and is a regular drinker in the pubs in Cheltenham town centre and Whaddon. Today Gloucestershire Police released images of Mr Spencer in the hope that the public will be able to help them track him down. They fear Mr Spencer may be looking to leave the country following the death of Ms Wiggett. Officers said that although Mr Spencer was not considered a threat to the public they should not approach him. A force spokesman said: ‘Danny Spencer is described as white, of stocky build and in his late 50s. ‘He appears to be bald or have close cropped grey hair. \\'He is not considered to pose a threat to the public, but the public should not approach him. ‘Police are keen to trace anyone who knew Jane, or who have seen her in the last month.’ Anyone who knows of Mr Spencer\\'s current whereabouts is asked to contact Gloucestershire Police on 101 quoting incident 457 of August 15. Alternatively call 0800 0560154, 0207 1580011 or 999.

Who else can really get away with this stuff? It\\'s a corporate world!\"\" The looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can\\'t be worn out in public and won\\'t be sold in stores. But let\\'s be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years. Meanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in \"\"Shame,\"\" of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck\\'s penis in \"\"Gone Girl,\"\" albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we\\'ve seen Ben Affleck\\'s penis, who cares about some male model\\'s? Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years. Perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor; that women are no longer required to do all the showing. That\\'s not a bad thing. Maybe the \"\"Free the Nipple\"\" people are finally getting their way, and women will be able to parade topless around town, or at the gym, or wherever they please, without stares or stigma (or arrest), as men have done for ages. More likely, it\\'s a clear sign that we\\'re a culture so overexposed that we\\'ve got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn. We are becoming -- have become -- immune to that which was previously surprising/revolting/ awe-inspiring. It\\'s amazing how quickly Lady Gaga went from outre to passe, isn\\'t it? Meanwhile, Madonna is a faint middle-aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with pointy bras -- positively puritanical compared to the starlets of today. Consider their norms: Going commando -- that\\'s \"\"without underwear,\"\" because, yes, there\\'s even a phrase for it. Giving birth on TV. Posing naked for mainstream magazines. The Kardashian sisters spent the fall one-upping each other -- first Kim\\'s naked backside on the cover of Paper (a sight credited with \"\"breaking the Internet\"\") and then Kourtney\\'s naked pregnant belly (and backside) online at DuJour, because if one reality sister does it, so, too, must the other. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, continues to one-up herself, graduating from foam fingers and lewd gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in V magazine, the release of which she celebrated with a crude shoutout on social media. But what\\'s next? What does she, or any of these women, do for an encore? Where does a jaded culture go from here for kicks? The envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits. What is left? Perhaps they\\'ll think of something. You just know those \"\"Most Shocking\"\" shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die. You know that some starlet on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape (yawn) to arrange to be caught in the act. Or maybe we\\'ll grow up and become more European in our sensibilities, and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast. Maybe we\\'ll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath. Whatever the impetus, the bottom is in sight. After all, being outrageous today is hard work, and only getting harder. The payoff, meanwhile, has nowhere to go but down.\",\"Peggy Drexler: Male models at Rick Owens\\' Paris runway show wore clothes that exposed their penises .\\nShe says as we become harder to shock, the culture keeps going lower and lower.

Jobs are available in Wisconsin\\'s brewing industry, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. In December, the Midwest posted the second-highest regional unemployment rate in the country, at 7.5 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Michigan, Indiana and Illinois all were in the top five states for total job losses. But, as CNN\\'s affiliate stations report, there are some bright spots in the picture these days for Midwestern job seekers. Nursing, brewing and transportation promise to bring new jobs to the region. And, like elsewhere, government jobs have taken on a new air of stability in part because of the economic stimulus package. Nursing Dawn Jarvis, of Indiana, became tired of the ups and downs of the real estate industry. So she decided to seek a career in nursing. \"\"It doesn\\'t dry up like real estate,\"\" she told CNN affiliate WRTV, of Indianapolis. \"\"You can take it with you wherever you go.\"\" The station reports that nurses on average make upwards of $30 per hour. As America\\'s population continues to age, health care is expected to be in increasing demand. The Indiana Health Care Association told WRTV that Indiana has the greatest need for nurses of any state. \"\"We have the highest vacancy rate for long-term care RNs [registered nurses] in the country, and it\\'s significantly higher than other states,\"\" association president Stephen Smith told the station. \"\"One of the top professions over the next 20 years is going to be nursing and the health care field in general because of the aging of the population.\"\" Read more about nurses in Indiana from WRTV . Brewing If you ever wondered what will happen to Wisconsin\\'s brewing industry in this sober economy, Carol Nolen has a question for you: . \"\"What better thing to do than come home at the end of the day and enjoy a beer?\"\" the president of Capitol Brewery asked CNN member station WKOW. And for a person coming home at the end of a long day of job searching, perhaps even more so. The brewing industry is doing well as others tank, WKOW reports. All of the news from the industry isn\\'t sterling. Some brewery stocks are down on the year, including those of SABMiller, the company that brews Miller products, the station says. But overall, WKOW reports that breweries are making money and keeping people employed. Read more on the brewing industry from WKOW . Transportation Being a school bus driver may not be the sexiest of jobs in the world. But it\\'s better than being unemployed, Ron Reynolds told WISC in Madison, Wisconsin. Driving schools in the area are full, and transportation companies, which normally have trouble filling their rosters, are awash with interest from applicants who seem to be more qualified than in years past, the station reports. Jerry Klabacka, director of Diesel Truck Driving School, told WISC that the industry is hiring truck drivers now, but that could change if companies slow their shipments of goods. The transportation industry in Madison \"\"is recession-proof in the standpoint that it always needs people,\"\" he said. \"\"However, when production goes down in this country, so does freight.\"\" For now, WISC reports that the local transportation sector in the area is seeing \"\"unprecedented growth.\"\" Read more from WISC . Government Damian Givens attended a recent job fair hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau in Greenwood, Indiana. He told WRTV that it\\'s \"\"refreshing\"\" to know that someone is offering jobs. The bureau, which takes a detailed survey of the American public every 10 years, plans to hire 900 people in the area by April 1, and another 1,000 employees next year, the station reports. All of those jobs pertain to the bureau\\'s 2010 survey. Workers will be paid between $11 and $13 an hour, WRTV says. Since the turnout at the jobs event in late February wasn\\'t high, the Census Bureau is still expecting applicants. Watch a WRTV video from the jobs event . \"\"We think there will be a lot more people, because jobs are hard to come by -- and the census is going to offer that opportunity for people,\"\" Dennis Sturdevant, of the Census Bureau, told WRTV. Chocolate In Anderson, Indiana, the chocolate maker Nestle is getting headlines for its decision to take a manufacturing plant back up to full capacity this week. \"\"The plant, which makes and distributes Nesquik and Coffee-Mate, has added hundreds of new jobs to a community desperately in need of positive economic news,\"\" WRTV reports. Nestle announced it would expand the plant by 880,000 square feet and had 100 more jobs, the station says. Originally, the chocolate maker had planned to add 300 jobs. Indiana\\'s governor touted the 100-job expansion as a success in hard times.

A mother-of-six was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from his\\xa0 £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball. Karen Buckland, 39, put \\'her life on the line\\' to save the 49-year driver after she found him slumped at the wheel at the silver GTC supercar as it was bursting into flames on his driveway. Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Buckland opened the driver\\'s side door of the blazing vehicle then used all of her strength to hoist him to safety. As she did so the fire ripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle - leaving it a burnt out wreck. Wreckage: Karen Buckland dragged her neighbour from his £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded in to flames on his driveway in Marple, near Stockport, Manchester . Brave: Mother-of-six Karen Buckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her \\'life on the line\\' to save her neighbour . The driver - a wealthy accountant with three children - was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood. Mrs Buckland was today commended for her bravery by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Mrs Buckland, from Marple, near Stockport, said: \\'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. We weren\\'t that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier.\\' Lucky escape: Mrs Buckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moment before the entire car went up in flames . Quick thinking: Mrs Buckland could smell electrics burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire . She added: \\'My husband nearly had to . drag me to the awards ceremony - frankly I didn\\'t know what the fuss was . about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put . on especially for me. \\'The . fact is my 16-year-old our daughter Morgan was there too and she was . brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a . neighbour helped as well - and the crews were obviously also very good. Lifesaver: Karen Buckland grabbed her neighbour under his arms and dragged him away from the car . \\'I was so touched and lost for words, . all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I did every day - . they are the real heroes in my opinion.\\' The . incident occurred when Mrs Buckland, who works as a director of . enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and and after . dinner realised she could smell burning. Mrs Buckland, who lives with property . developer husband Eain, 52, said: \\'Eain was still at work, so Morgan and . I were watching television. \\'I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble drier and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew. \\'He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been revving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Bentley was on fire and the flames were spreading fast. \\'He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen.\\' With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house - burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack - all Mrs Buckland could think about was rescuing the man before he burned to death. She said: \\'I didn\\'t reason, I just did it. I didn\\'t think about myself or anything else; it\\'s all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. As I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there.\\' Mrs Buckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Morgan called 999 and asked for help. Morgan took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room and crews from Marple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze and took over from Karen and gave first aid to the man. Presentation: Karen Buckland being presented with a County Fire Officer\\'s Commendation with her husband Eain her daughter Morgan and Chief Officer Steve McGuirk . Mrs Buckland said: \\'As he lay on the . ground unconscious, he looked in a bad way - he was singed, covered in . smoke and foaming and gurgling from the mouth.

It\\'s a constant reminder. Well-deserved: Karen Buckland pictured holding her award next to her proud daughter Morgan . \\'It wasn\\'t until later and I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was. \\'Morgan had some flashbacks, but apart from that we\\'ve been okay - we\\'re just happy he\\'s alive. \\'I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one. \\'It\\'s so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him. \\'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him - if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story. \\'I didn\\'t think about the danger to me - you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself. \\'The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis.\\' Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an \\'over revving\\' of the car\\'s engine. County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: \\'It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Karen not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his. \\'Karen put her life on the line - watched by her family - to save this man and let there be no underestimation of the courage and strength of character that such actions take.\\' Completely destroyed: The £140,000 Bentley is now a complete wreck after the explosion .\",\"Karen Buckland found her neighbour unconscious in his £140,000 Bentley .\\nThe GTC supercar was on fire on his driveway in Marple, near Stockport .\\nMother-of-six pulled driver to safety moment before car went up in flames .\\nMrs Buckland has been commended for her bravery by the fire service .\"\\n0076f01b59fbd43bb1f6fe3d00e70f30622befdb,\"(CNN) -- There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare: . Mutual assured destruction. What it means is that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. Everyone will die. National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat: . War rooms. Battleground states. Attack ads. And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year\\'s presidential campaign may turn out to be the dirtiest ever. You\\'ve already seen it in the wall-to-wall television commercials during the primary season; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive, you can expect the tone of the advertising to make sewage seem pristine by comparison. As Peggy Noonan wrote in The Wall Street Journal: \"\"With all the PAC money floating around, we\\'ve entered the Golden Age of mudslinging.\"\" It\\'s not that the candidates are incapable of high-mindedness; they are extraordinarily bright. But in recent years the mantra of high-octane campaigns has been that below-the-belt tactics work, and the rationalization has been that a candidate can\\'t accomplish anything worthy if he or she doesn\\'t get elected in the first place. Jim Rutenberg, in The New York Times, under the headline \"\"The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Race for President,\"\" wrote last month: \"\"The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation\\'s challenges seriously.\"\" That, he wrote, is looking like an unrealistic expectation, and thus \"\"Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol.\"\" From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective. It never seems to stick. Carol E. Lee, writing in The Wall Street Journal: \"\"Neither side shows any signs of curtailing the negativity. ... One effect of such early negativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier.\"\" Why does this matter? With politics more of a spectator sport than ever, what is the real harm in its devolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling? The harm is that it\\'s a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted. The metaphorical eye-gouging and groin-kicking of take-no-prisoners campaigns may be effective in grabbing voters\\' attention -- increasingly, watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to gape at a particularly ugly auto accident. But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it. In a front-page story in USA Today before the conventions began, Susan Page reported that a USA Today/Gallup Poll \"\"finds Americans taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago.\"\" Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other. To an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons, voters say that they view both the Republican and Democratic parties unfavorably. When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes. This year, asked the same question, only 12% said yes. And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style. In warfare, the hoped-for impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace, however strained or uneasy -- it was, and is, a doctrine of deterrence. In politics, it doesn\\'t seem to inhibit the combatants. A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president. But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process. There is a publication that has none of the glitz or dinner-party cachet of the national newspapers or television news networks, but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs. The publication is the AARP Bulletin -- circulation 22 million -- and its editor, Jim Toedtman, recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective. Under the headline \"\"Leaders, Try Greatness, Not Meanness,\"\" Toedtman said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying \"\"no interest in compromise,\"\" and quoted Allegheny College President James H. Mullen Jr. in characterizing the current process as \"\"a disgraceful stew of invective ... a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil, uncaring or, worst of all, unpatriotic.\"\" Does it have to be this way? The editorial recalls John Adams, who \"\"could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress\\' decisions would be dictated \\'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; by contracted hearts, not large souls.\\'\"\" Adams wrote, \"\"There must be decency and respect and veneration introduced for persons of authority of every rank or we are undone. In popular government, this is our only way.\\'\"\" When the country loses that, it loses something essential. Just what is it that we are throwing away? Toedtman\\'s editorial concludes: \"\"Decency, respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years. We are surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance. The measure for our leaders must be their ability to rediscover that proven formula of sense, greatness and learning.\"\" But what political consultant would waste his client\\'s money trying to fit those sentiments into a 30-second commercial? Meanwhile, Election Day is less than 10 weeks away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.\",\"Bob Greene: Political campaigns resemble warfare\\'s mutually assured destruction .\\nHe says politicians believe the only way to win is by using below-the-belt tactics .\\nA poll showed that Americans take an increasingly dim view of negative campaigns, candidates .\\nGreene: When the country loses decency, respect, it loses something essential .\"\\n007880654accdde3b5cdbf102d44104c9c62f3ea,\"By .

TED normally attracts an audience of the elite of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and venture capital, along with foundation and corporate CEOs, who pay $7,500 for the five-day event, which is moving next year from Long Beach to Vancouver. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers). TED stands for \"\"technology, entertainment and design,\"\" although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago. The ingenuity of this year\\'s youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas. Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno. He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14. In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies. Rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine, Wilson\\'s new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt. His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground. He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors. Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said. Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite. Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said. And most exciting to the young space geek, such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination, he said. Andraka, who\\'s 16 and a high school sophomore, won the top prize in the Intel Science Fair competition for his cancer screening test, which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers, providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure. He told CNN in an interview that he doesn\\'t go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projects -- including inventing an MRI the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $10 million Tricorder X Prize to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health. Andraka and Wilson probably don\\'t have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED. Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices. By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue. \"\"Thirty is not the new twenty,\"\" she said, urging people to \"\"claim your adulthood\"\" and start making choices. Spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, a 36-year-old whose new video \"\"To This Day\"\" has attracted 5.5 million views, offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve, many still carry a heavy burden. He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself. He spoke of kids being called names, making them feel like \"\"oddities juggling depression and loneliness\"\" and challenged them: . \"\"if you can\\'t see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there\\'s something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit\"\"\",\"TED2013 conference theme was \"\"The Young.

But when others look at Shazia they see something else: a misfit. Shazia dances for the cameras at a party. \"\"People start staring at me in such a manner as if an animal from the jungle has come into the city.\"\" Shazia says. Shazia belongs to Pakistan\\'s community of eunuchs. It is a term here that loosely refers to transsexuals, transvestites or hermaphrodites, like Shazia, who are born with both male and female sex organs. For Shazia what nature created, has made a life of hell. \"\"I get so confused. I feel very strange that Allah could have made me a boy, or he could have made me a girl, but this way, neither boy nor girl. This life is very strange. It is a bad life,\"\" Shazia said. \"\"I do not want to accept this life. Had it been legal to commit suicide I would have done it.\"\" When she was a child, Shazia said she had no doubt that she felt more a girl than a boy.  Watch Shazia handle stares from men » . \"\"When I used to go to school there used to be benches for boys on one side and girls on the other; my teacher always made me sit with the girls.\"\" she said. Shazia left home when she was in her early teens. She said it was to save her family embarrassment and shame. Like other eunuchs in Pakistan, she has lived in colonies. They are often shunned by their families and forced to make a living by begging or as prostitutes. The colonies can be brutal places, where young people are often beaten and exploited. When Shazia was 17, she says she was drugged and the head of the colony performed brutal surgery severing Shazia\\'s penis. But Shazia has survived the taunts, the humiliation and the savagery; now she is fighting back. Shazia has formed an action group and is campaigning for eunuchs like her to get proper recognition. Right now her state identity card lists her as a male. She wants to be counted as a whole person. Shazia has found a champion, human rights lawyer, Muhammad Aslan Khaki. Dr. Khaki presented a petition to the Supreme Court, leading to the first register of eunuchs in Pakistan. The court has ordered Pakistan\\'s government departments to carry out a survey and recommend measures to fully integrate eunuchs into society without prejudice. In earlier centuries eunuchs were seen as having the power to bring good luck. For Shazia and others, their luck may finally be changing.\",\"Pakistan\\'s eunuch community campaigns for proper recognition .\\nIn Pakistan the term covers transsexuals, transvestites, hermaphrodites .\\nShazia, a hermaphrodite, tells how her penis was removed at 17 .\\nShe says she feels she is a woman, but her identity card calls her male .\"\\n007a3697265477abf9f8f467366a0303bec5a446,\"It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. And it has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Obama administration\\'s assertion that there wasn\\'t enough information to deploy forces - deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack on September 11th and its aftermath . Scroll down for video . Revelations: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 11 . The lethal assault which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Fox News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the embattled diplomatic compound. However, they were told to \\'stand down\\' and according to sources who spoke to the news channel were told to \\'stand down\\' again after asking for a second time to help Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Woods and two others heroically made their way to the consulate which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attackers. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces teams . The quick reaction force which Woods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Sean Smith who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy which is two hours away, it is claimed that two separate special operations teams and air support were told to wait - despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operatives on the ground at Benghazi. If true these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticised for providing inadequate security for the consulate staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta\\'s claim yesterday that there simply wasn\\'t enough information to responsibly deploy forces to Libya at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested backup from a Specter gunship to take out an attacker firing mortars. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the consulate attackers were firing from. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military\\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Carter Ham, head of the U.S. military\\'s Africa Command, felt they couldn\\'t \\'put forces at risk in that situation.\\' A CIA operatives request for an AC-130H gunship to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied . Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate\\'s exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . \\'This happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,\\' said Panetta. Furthermore, Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyrone Woods and another former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrive. This new information comes as President Barack Obama\\'s response to the attacks in Libya has become a contentious issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration\\'s truthfulness and competence. Obama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner, asked in a letter to Obama on Thursday about whether military options and assets were offered \\'during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack.\\' \\'Can you explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be pre-positioned, let alone utilized?\\' Boehner asked. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet anti-terrorist security team to Tripoli and had Navy ships off the coast. \\'And we were prepared to respond to any contingency. And certainly had forces in place to do that,\\' he said. Elite team: As the U.S. consulate in Benghazi . came under a devastating attack last month, a rescue team of elite . soldiers was denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack . The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Obama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to \\'the fog of war.\\' A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department\\'s Operations Center advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Ansar al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook for the attacks. U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November - after the November 6 presidential election - on security and intelligence issues raised by the September 11 attack in Libya.\",\"Revelations shed new light on the effectiveness of the CIA at Benghazi and the level of support they were given .\\nWhen the CIA annex come under attack the field agents were denied a request for military help despite a counter terrorism team being two hours away in Italy .\\nThere was full communication between operatives on the ground and headquarters - with the ability to laser guide drones, planes or special forces to enemy targets .\"\\n007a8f8c0af4b027d9aaf3e7b7937e51e53bfea7,\"Andy Murray appeared simply delighted on Christmas Day as he threw on a festive jumper for the seasonal celebrations.

Discovery of the fetuses, which came from illegal abortion clinics, have led to six morticians being detained for questioning, police Lt. Col. Chusak Kumsai said. The chief of morticians admitted receiving fetuses from several clinics, Kumsai said. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for cremation. The fetuses have been taken from the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok to the Chulongkorn Forensic Institute for investigation, police said. \"\"I think [the fetuses were at the temple] because the new incinerators are under construction,\"\" nearby resident Puak Eiamchan said. \"\"So the temple can\\'t receive any dead bodies to cremate for almost two months now.\"\" \"\"I believe that people who did this must have done it for some time and it was exposed because they can\\'t burn the fetuses and they were accumulated to hundreds and the smell started to tell.\"\" Abortion is illegal in Thailand, but women are allowed to one if they are the victims of rape, or if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, according to Pavena Hongskul, founder of the Pavena Foundation for Children and Women.\",\"The smell of decay leads to the discovery .\\nThe fetuses came from illegal abortion clinics, police say .\\nThe chief of morticians admit receiving fetuses from several clinics .\\nTemples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for cremation .\"\\n007ddc6d5805b3c515bc2ca8843dcff28ec4903c,\"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can\\'t afford to have a mayor who is getting \\'on-the-job training.\\' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions . Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city\\'s \\'renaissance.\\' \\'If the people don\\'t want me, they don\\'t have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,\\' he said during a break in his show. \\'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I\\'ve accomplished.\\' Cianci\\'s announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007 . Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence . He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won\\'t keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice \\'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head . The city\\'s demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running. Lorne Adrain filed as an independent. A few of the candidates issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci\\'s entry. \\'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci\\'s candidacy represents,\\' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. He said voters want to \\'keep moving forward.\\' Adrain said Cianci\\'s announcement won\\'t affect his campaign. \\'The people of Providence are well familiar with his history,\\' he said.\",\"Cianci served six terms as the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island .\\nHe is often given credit for the city\\'s rise as a cultural hub .\\nCianci\\'s first felony conviction was for assault after he beat a man with a log and a lit cigarette .\\nHis second conviction was related to wide-spread corruption in his administration .\\nCianci served nearly five years in prison for the corruption charges .\"\\n0080a94a2c7a15e2e9d6e1705510e1b2e662b894,\"Security experts have warned Android smartphone owners to update their software and be wary of clicking untrusted links - as they could reset your phone back to its factory setting without warning. Researchers found that malicious hackers can create web-links that can wipe your phone - meaning all your files, personal details, images and music would be wiped, just by getting you to click on a web-link. The exploit has been tested on Samsung phones, but could potentially be work on handsets from companies such as HTC. The bug exploits a feature in many phones . from Samsung where clicking on a link can automatically dial a . number into your dial-pad and click \\'Call\\'. The Galaxy S2 is likely to still be at risk from the \\'link-jacking\\', which could reset a phone by following a URL - which can automatically dial \\'magic codes\\' from your phonebook . While this is a handy feature in some cases - for instance, calling a restaurant directly from a web-page - it opens the door for malicious uses. Many manufacturers add hidden commands to your phonebook - for instance, dialling *#*#4636#*#* will automatically show you your phone\\'s secret setting menus. But some manufacturers, including Samsung, add additional codes - and one of them automatically resets your phone, without any way of interrupting the process. The exploit was first announced by Ravi Borgaonkar, from the Technische Universitat in . Berlin. He said web links could be embedded in text messages, clicked on in a web browser, or scanned using a QR \\'barcode\\' tag. When Borgaonkar announced his finding yesterday, he said there was nothing a Samsung owner can do to stop it. Android is rapidly becoming one of the most established operating systems in the world. This month - just before the iPhone launch on September 12th - Andy Rubin, the Google executive who founded Android, announced that 500 million Android devices had been activated across the world. The pace of adoption is rapidly speeding up - from around 500,000 activations a day a year ago, to 900 daily activations in June, to more than 1.3million activations a day by September. So far, there have been few serious security breeches for Android and Apple devices, in terms of causing a financial cost to the end-user. But as our phones become more widespread and become a bigger part of our daily lives - for instance, when used as a wallet to make payments - it is likely hackers and criminals will find new ways to target devices. However, the exploit only appears to work on some models, and Samsung has released a security update to block the problem. Samsung said there is a fix out for the flagship Galaxy S3 has already been issued, but has not referred to other models yet, such as its bestselling Galaxy S2. The spokesman said: \\'We would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY S III has already been resolved through a software update. \\'We recommend all GALAXY S III customers to download the latest software update, which can be done quickly and easily via the Over-The-Air (OTA) service.\\' Users can find updates by clicking on Settings | About Phone | Software updates. Some users also report the problem can occur on HTC handsets, but this is still under investigation. Developers for Android said they had also adapted the operating system to prevent the exploit. However Android\\'s well-known slow update process - due to the varieties of different handsets, and phone networks insisting on adding \\'bloatware\\' to their own devices - means this may not roll out to users quickly. In practice, few users are likely to come across a link which will affect their phone in this way, but anyone who is concerned should seek out an app in the Play Store called TelStop.\",\"Samsung phones could be wiped if a hacker codes a website address to activate the \\'reset\\' switch .\\nOther Android phones, such as from HTC, may also be vulnerable to exploit .\"\\n0080ea67d5fbfb2648a23ee827d84b80a9b0a37a,\"(CNN) -- Ireland opened the defense of their Six Nations rugby title with a 29-11 victory at home to Italy, while England repelled the challenge of Wales to win 30-17 in Saturday\\'s other match. Ireland, who won all five matches last year to complete a Grand Slam, led 23-8 at halftime in Dublin but could not run away with victory against a determined visiting team. Recalled flyhalf Ronan O\\'Gara became the first player to score 500 points in the tournament as he was successful with all six kicks at goal, while Jamie Heaslip and Tomas O\\'Leary crossed for first-half tries. Italy\\'s only try came just before halftime, despite the sin-binning of center Gonzalo Garcia meaning coach Nick Mallett\\'s team were reduced to 14 men, after a charge-down of Rob Kearney\\'s kick by Kaine Robertson. \"\"It\\'s not easy to click immediately having only been together for two weeks and not having played together since November,\"\" Ireland captain Brian O\\'Driscoll told reporters. \"\"There is plenty to improve on. It\\'s the first one and job done. We\\'ll take the positives out of it and move on. We showed an ability in the first half to turn defense into attack and the amount of lineout ball we won was a big plus. \"\"We made some good line breaks but didn\\'t finish them off. Maybe we need to improve our support play.\"\" England flanker James Haskell scored two tries to lift the pressure on head coach Martin Johnson, as Wales paid the price for Alun-Wyn Jones\\' sin-binning with 17 points conceded while the lock was off the field at Twickenham. The match was level at 3-3 when Jones was yellow-carded for leg-tripping England hooker Dylan Hartley, and the hosts subsequently scored a penalty and two converted tries, Haskell\\'s first in Tests and another five minutes after halftime by scrumhalf Danny Care. Wales battled back to 20-17 down with eight minutes left as Jones made some amends by setting up prop Adam Jones for a try and then James Hook crossed for another. But four minutes later Haskell went over again thanks to Delon Armitage\\'s interception, and then Jonny Wilkinson kicked his third penalty, this one from the halfway line to give the flyhalf 15 points for the match. Wales coach Warren Gatland was furious after Jones\\' indiscipline cost his side dear. \"\"We are frustrated and disappointed. We felt that was a game that has slipped from our grasp,\"\" the New Zealander told reporters. \"\"The yellow card has cost us 17 points -- it was one of those things, stupid. It was massive. Sometimes those things are very, very costly, and it was for us today. \"\"We had stressed discipline over the past two weeks and talked about giving nothing soft away, and it is frustrating we have done that.

The Army commander of a remote Alaskan base is under investigation for sexual misconduct, after allegedly allowing officers to have affairs and for permitting scantily clad women soldiers to pose for a calendar. Soldiers at the anti-ballistic missile base claimed  Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley had created a \\'toxic environment\\' by turning a blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct. It was claimed that women soldiers at Fort Greely were also being allowed to trade sexual favors for favorable treatment from officers. Target: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley\\'s wife, Tracey, featured as the August picture on a racy calender he approved of women at the base . Even if sexual misconduct is consensual, the Army forbids commanders to have relationships with their subordinates. Marco Morales, spokesman for the Space . and Missile Defense Command, confirmed the commander was under investigation in an email . obtained by Bloomberg. Incidents of inappropriate sexual relations between officers and soldiers had increased because no disciplinary action was being taken, according to three sources, who spoke to the news agency on the condition of anonymity. Lieutenant Colonel Miley declined to comment about the allegations when contacted by Bloomberg, referring the news agency to unit’s public affairs office. The spokesman there directed queries to the Space and Missile Defense Command. An anonymous complaint was made against Lieutenant Colonel Miley earlier in the year, after he promoted a racy calender featuring his wife Tracey as the August shot, alongside women from the base. An alleged inappropriate relationship had formed between the soldier who took the photos and one of the soldiers who posed in it. The owner of a bar near the base, defended the $25 charity calender for the American Cancer Society as \\'tasteful\\' and said it had been selling well. Family values: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, with his wife Tracey, and daughter . Criticized: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, pictured with his wife Tracey and child, is accused of creating a \\'toxic environment\\' Patsy Ewing, co-owner of Clearwater Lodge, told Army Times she had received no complaints about the calendar, which features a shot taken in her establishment. She added however, that the bar did not attract conservative customers. Lieutenant General Richard Formica, of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said the allegation would be investigated, but that he did not believe there had been any \\'wrongdoing\\', according to the Army Times. He added that any potential impact on the command and its family readiness group would be monitored. In an email to Lieutenant General . Richard Formica, head of the Space and Missile Defense Command, soldiers . at the base complained that Commander Miley’s alleged condoning of sexual affairs left them fearing \\'for our wives and even our children in this toxic environment\\'. At least 16 women serve at Fort . Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the . ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea. Military officials told NBC News that by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in effect, created an \\'open season\\' when it came to sexual activity among troops. One official said: \\'It\\'s as if that was the only thing to do\\' at the remote base. It comes as the Department of Defense . increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this . month that the number of cases has increased in the past year. Remote: The Army\\'s Fort Greely anti-ballistic missile base is located in the Alaskan wilderness . Defense: Fort Greely is a launch site for missiles capable of taking down long-range weapons .

As they doggedly work the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that\\'s markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to the podium. \"\"We want to change the Republican Party,\"\" said Chris Stearns, the Virginia state director for the Ron Paul campaign. \"\"We are making sure our people get in positions of leadership -- in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level.\"\" Libertarians such as Stearns aspire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and anti-abortion forces in the 1980s. Many of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top rungs of the GOP now. And similar to that movement, Ron Paul and his campaigners for liberty are looking down the road. \"\"This is not just for this term,\"\" Stearns told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, \"\"but four, six or eight years from now.\"\" Nearly 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate Ron Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. \"\"Four years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,\"\" said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New York to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral politics. He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia\\'s 8th Congressional District. Battle in the grass roots . That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and pundits, but it\\'s where Ron Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state\\'s delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The 8th District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Arlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Four years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The 8th District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. This is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. Show up. Vote. \"\"We have been calling and e-mailing,\"\" Bailey said ahead of the vote. \"\"Our turnout\\'s looking great.\"\" But some feel it is an attempt at political hijacking. \"\"There are people out here who are still fighting for Ron Paul who got defeated at our primary,\"\" said Fran Redmon, who has been involved in the 8th District Republican Party for 40 years. \"\"It\\'s so ridiculous. They should either be a Republican or not be here today.\"\" Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Redmon replied, \"\"I think they aren\\'t really thinking it through. I suppose they think we\\'re people who don\\'t have an agenda or something.\"\" Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the libertarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second-ballot gambit . \"\"This is a movement,\"\" said Homan Rabie, who came to the 8th District convention with his high school friends, \"\"(Republicans) need a true philosophy.\"\" They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. So it\\'s a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Mitt Romney on the first ballot. Let\\'s get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the 8th District convention mentioned a much-forwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstains, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Many Paul supporters told CNN they think it\\'s a pipe dream. They\\'re distancing themselves from the idea. \"\"To me personally, it doesn\\'t look like any way that\\'s going to happen,\"\" said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Tampa. \"\"I don\\'t see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a ruckus. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat (if Republicans don\\'t win in November).\"\" Change the party from the bottom up . Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention \"\"is not in my plan. That is against my plan.\"\" The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginia\\'s 8th District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Burrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Tampa. Stearns says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the up-for-grabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota\\'s delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it\\'s learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. \"\"We\\'re all getting training on the ground now,\"\" he said. \"\"At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practice for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win.\"\" It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but stamina.\",\"Ron Paul supporters want bottom-to-top takeover of GOP .\\nPart of the plan is electing supporters to party posts from local level and up .\\nSupporters say they\\'re looking beyond 2012 to what\\'s down the road .\\n\"\"At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time,\"\" Paul director says .\"\\n00820005201f0513a5ff6defb5494c1c5160ef79,\"By . Jack Doyle and Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 17 February 2012 . Theresa May will visit . Jordan in a bid to secure radical cleric Abu Qatada\\'s extradition to the country, it was announced today. Qatada has been released from jail under . strict bail conditions while the Government seeks assurances that . evidence gained through torture would not be used in any trial against . him. But times is ticking because the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Shock: Abu Qatada\\'s (pictured earlier this week) landlord has told of his shock after discovering the radical cleric is living in his house with his family and has been in touch with the lettings agent to have him removed . The Home Secretary said today: \\'The UK and Jordan remain committed to . ensuring that Abu Qatada must face justice and are pursuing all options . with regard to his deportation and it is my intention to travel back to . continue those negotiations shortly.\\' Meanwhile the landlord of the house . where hate preacher Abu Qatada is living following his release from . prison has revealed he had no idea he was even there. The landlord said he wants the radical cleric out . and has already been in contact with letting agents who rented the . property out on his behalf. He said he had let the . house in Wembley, north-west London out to a woman and her four children . who had a different name to Qatada. But the 51-year-old cleric moved in with his wife and children to the £400,000 property after being freed from maximum security Long Lartin on Monday night. His release as the result of a European human rights ruling caused outrage after it emerged 60 police will keep tabs on him, costing taxpayers £10,000 a week . But the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Speaking after he heard the news the landlord, who cannot be identified, said he rented the property out on January 9 to a woman and four children whose name is different to Qatada. She signed a year\\'s contract with a six month break clause. He said: \\'If he is living there I want him out. I’ve been on the phone to the agents all day. They didn’t even tell me. \\'I don’t want someone like that living there. It’s not good for me. I would never rent my property to someone like Qatada. \\'This is not something I stand for, it is humiliating. I cannot believe it. I want Abu Qatada and his family out of my house.\\' Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet . The landlord added: \\'I am shocked. I knew nothing about this.\\' He said he was called by a lettings agency in January saying the woman wanted to rent the property on a year\\'s contract. The tenancy agreement was drawn up and he was told the woman did not have a husband. He said the woman claims benefits and is paying him £1,900 a month. It comes as yesterday a senior European human rights official has admitted Britain would face no real punishment if Qatada was put on a plane tomorrow. Thomas Hammarberg said ‘there isn’t really a sanction’ were the government to ignore the European Court of Human Rights and deport the radical preacher. The comments will heap pressure on Home Office ministers to ignore the court’s ruling and send Qatada back to Jordan. The radical cleric, described by a British court as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ was released on bail this week as a result of the Strasbourg ruling. Tory backbenchers have challenged Home Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to deport dangerous foreign nationals. Yesterday, in a further blow to hopes of deporting Qatada, a senior member of the Jordanian royal family appeared to pour scorn on the idea it would give in to Strasbourg’s demands. Speaking to the BBC, Prince El Hassan of Jordan, uncle of King Abdullah, said: ‘If this man has committed crimes which is presumably why he is being held in England, I don’t know what kind of court one has to offer to the Europeans. Does it want a juvenile court?’ No sanctions: Thomas Hammarberg, a senior official, said kicking Abu Qatada out would \\'set a negative example\\' He added: ‘This is essentially a British European conversation and I don’t think democracy means that we have to appeal to every single European parliamentarian.’ Mr Hammarberg is commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, the court’s governing body. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper he accused ministers of not even reading the court’s judgement in the case. Asked what the repercussions would be if Britain ignored the court’s ruling, he said: ‘Someone may file a complaint and there would be a judgment that there’s a violation of human rights, but it’s more the bad example. ‘It would send a signal that the UK, which currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe, is ignoring [judgments] and that would be such a bad signal. There would be a chain effect.’ ‘It would set a negative example that would be used by other countries in Europe which are less keen on human rights. It would be extremely unfortunate to ignore the ruling. It’s a serious ruling and a serious matter.’ He added: ‘I have read the discussions in the UK and know that [Abu Qatada] is seen as a dangerous person. So I understand the heat but I’m not impressed by the arguments.’ ‘The key point in the [ECHR] judgment in Strasbourg is torture, but it seems that the arguments have become about whether Britain should co-operate with European institutions. ‘It seems the ministers had not even read the judgments. They mixed up the EU and the Council of Europe. It was about torture, not whether to co-operate with European institutions. Mr Hammarberg’s intervention is likely to inflame tensions between London and the council, at a time when ministers are trying to agree reforms to how the court works. Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet. The ECHR judges said Qatada could not be sent back because he would not get a fair trial in Jordan - because evidence could be used against him which resulted from torture. Home Office minister James Brokenshire travelled to Jordan earlier this week to attempt to broker a deal which would satisfy the ECHR. Mrs May said: \\'The Home Office . Minister for Crime and Security, James Brokenshire MP, has led useful . discussions with the Jordanian authorities and talks with officials will . continue.\\' Mr Hammarberg said the court would need ‘watertight guarantees’ that evidence obtained from torture would not be used against Qatada at trial. His comments sparked fury in Westminster last night. Tory MP for Esher and Walton Dominic Raab said: ‘If Mr Hammarberg thinks Britain should go back cap in hand to the Strasbourg Court after this ludicrous judgment, he’s got another thing coming. In fact, since he is neither a judge nor an elected politician, he is pretty irrelevant to this debate.’\",\"Home Secretary Theresa May to fly to Jordan in bid to deport Qatada .\\nHuman Rights official says deporting hate preacher would set a \\'bad example\\'\\nOfficial admits UK \\'could ignore Euro ruling on Qatada and face no real punishment\\'\\nAbu\\'s landlord thought his London home had been let to a single mother and four children .\\nHe wants the radical cleric and his family out of his £400,000 house .\"\\n008208e9995f28b903d54a64278449f8de4cbe61,\"New Delhi (CNN) -- Let\\'s hear it for \"\"the man of the moment, the man of the millennium.\"\" That man is Narendra Modi, and those are the words with which an Australian public servant introduced India\\'s Prime Minister in Brisbane on Sunday. \"\"Modi, Modi, Modi,\"\" chanted the crowd. The adulation didn\\'t end there. The next day, Modi was in Sydney, delivering a speech to an audience of 16,000 at the Allphones Arena. \"\"You\\'re a rock star!\"\" shrieked an excited fan as the event beamed across millions of television screens in India and around the world. And so it was that #Rockstar and #ModiInAustralia began trending on Twitter. Tuesday: new city, new audience. Modi pitched up at the Australian Parliament in Canberra. He spoke in English this time, highlighting the linguistic and cultural commonalities between India and Australia -- almost as if to suggest India was a better trading partner than China. \"\"Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India\\'s progress. ... India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities,\"\" Modi declared. Is India really the one-stop answer? And is Modi really the man of the millennium? The hype seems to be reaching dangerous levels. There\\'s no denying that Modi has generated immense excitement in India and abroad. Rightfully so. Here, finally, is an Indian leader who says the things Indians have been yearning to hear. He talks about faster growth, creating jobs, about a smartphone in every hand, a toilet in every home, clean streets, leaner and more transparent government. And boy, can he talk. In Hindi, in Gujarati, in English, Modi seems to know exactly what his audience wants to hear. In that sense he is indeed a rock star, riffing on his key anthems at every big speech. But can he deliver the runaway platinum sales Indians now seem to expect? We\\'re beginning to see the first signs of questions being asked. Earlier this month, at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in New Delhi, top industrialist Anand Mahindra told CNN that Modi\\'s \"\"honeymoon period is over.\"\" When CNN spoke with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he seemed to dial back on expectations of big reforms, saying \"\"people with their sense of wisdom will be able to appreciate\"\" the cumulative effect of the government\\'s smaller steps. And then there are the questions of Modi himself. At the inauguration of a hospital in Mumbai last month, Modi made a speech, played out live on many Indian TV channels. Curiously, one bit was ignored by the Indian press. Speaking of the Hindu god Ganesha -- who is depicted as having an elephant\\'s head -- Modi claimed that Ganesha\\'s half-man, half-elephant body was evidence that ancient Indian doctors were experts at the art of plastic surgery. Seriously? The Indian TV anchor and journalist Karan Thapar was one of the few to raise an eyebrow. \"\"He believes in digital India, wants to import bullet trains and \\'Make in India\\' state-of-the-art (defense) weaponry,\"\" Thapar wrote. \"\"These are 21st-century ambitions. How does all of that sit alongside this belief in unverified mythology?\"\" He added, \"\"The silence of the media is deeply disturbing. It feels as though it\\'s been deliberately blanked out by everyone.\"\" I doubt there\\'s a larger media conspiracy only to portray Modi positively. But the media do need to take a step back and question the rock-star levels of adulation. Modi has gotten India dreaming. Who knows, those dreams may even be realized one day. But in Modi\\'s seven months as Prime Minister so far, rhetoric and big plans aside, nothing has really changed. For hundreds of millions of poor Indians, it is still the same India. Basic infrastructure is still subpar; there are no social safety nets on health care or pensions; India is still an immensely frustrating place to live and work. And that\\'s the tip of an enormous iceberg. India could take decades to change. We all need to remember that. So do Modi\\'s fans.\",\"Narendra Modi, India\\'s Prime Minister, continues to draw praise for his speeches .\\nRavi Agrawal says the Prime Minister talks about the issues that matter, particularly jobs .\\nHe says some people think it\\'s time to match rhetoric with action .\\nAgrawal: People should have realistic expectations; it may take decades to change India .\"\\n00828c37629fb44c262d55642efb4a008291b79b,\"Neymar claims he is reproducing his Brazil form for Barcelona now that he is feeling more relaxed at the Nou Camp.

The Catalans failed to win any silverware last season but  they are top of La Liga after eight games and are yet to concede a goal under new coach Luis Enrique this term.

Back at Atletico on loan after an dreadful spell at Chelsea, the former £50m striker lashed a first-time effort high into the net past goalkeeper Keylor Navas to put Atletico 1-0 ahead on the night and 3-0 up on aggregate. The 30-year-old, included in the starting lineup in place of an ailing Mario Mandzukic, had never scored against Real at their Bernabeu stadium and, after Sergio Ramos made it 1-1, he restored Atletico\\'s lead with a neat finish just after the interval. Click here for Pete Jenson\\'s full match report . Host commentator . Simeone has pulled off a tactical masterclass at the Santiago Bernabeu. Torres\\' double proved to be significant as Atletico progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. Ramos and Ronaldo struck for the home side but they were unable to find a further three goals. Attention now turns to Barcelona\\'s clash against Elche. Atletico Madrid are starting to control possession now. Real look extremely despondent. Not exactly a brave prediction but it does not look like Real are going to be able to pull the three-goal deficit (due to Atletico\\'s away goals) back. They appear to have run out of steam with just under 10 minutes left on the clock. Ancelotti will have been extremely disappointed with his side\\'s display today. His attacking trio of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema have failed to impress this evening. Just to remind you, Real need three goals in under 20 minutes if they are to progress to the next round of the Copa del Rey. The winners are likely to face Barcelona, who lead Elche 5-0 from the first leg. Benzema has to do better. The Frenchman blasts the ball over the bar from close range to the delight of Atletico\\'s defender. Surely time for Hernandez to be given a chance. With 67 minutes gone, Ronaldo - despite scoring Real\\'s second - has hardly had a sniff at goal. The Ballon d\\'Or winner will be extremely disappointed with how his night is panning out. Navas pushes a Griezmann free-kick over the bar. The away side have been able to get further up the pitch during the second half. Simeone\\'s tactics have been spot on so far. Torres has been denied the chance of grabbing a hat-trick. Simeone has decided to replace his January signing with Turan. The former Chelsea striker was a staggering 250/1 to score a hat-trick before the match. This tie is just getting better and better. Bale crosses the ball to Ronaldo, who heads the ball past Oblak. 2-2 with 55 minutes on the clock. Torres worms his way into the box before the ball falls to Griezmann, whose deflected shot goes just wide. Sportsmail\\'s Pete Jenson: \\'Oh my, 37 seconds this time. Torres has silenced the Bernabeu. \"\"Fer-nan-do Torres!\"\" sing Atletico Madrid\\'s 500 supporters.\\' Real Madrid obviously didn\\'t learn from Torres\\' opener as the former Chelsea forward has scored a similar goal to his first. He links up with Griezmann again before slotting the ball under Navas\\' legs. Ancelotti does not have many attacking options on the subs\\' bench. He will surely turn to Hernandez during the second half..\\xa0Real\\'s bench: Casillas, Varane,\\xa0Coentrao,\\xa0Khedira,\\xa0Hernandez,\\xa0Jese,\\xa0Illarramendi . Simeone will be delighted with the scoreline at half-time despite the fact his side have been camped inside their own half during the first half. Torres opened the scoring inside the first minute before Ramos pulled a goal back 19 minutes later. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo\\'s shot at goal appears to hit Miranda\\'s arm. However referee\\xa0Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz \\xa0waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo\\'s shot at goal appears to hit Miranda\\'s arm. However referee\\xa0Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz \\xa0waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Karim Benzema has been extremely quiet during the first half. Ancelotti may decide to throw on Javier Hernandez after the interval. Atletico are finding it hard to get on the ball. The away side are hoping to hit Real on the counter attack, as they did with the first goal, but Real are not relinquishing possession. Real Madrid are still looking for a second goal. Ancelotti cannot fault the passion and effort of his players despite the early goal by Torres. 10 minutes to go until the interval. Atletico are doing everything they can to stop Real from going in front before the interval. They are finding it hard to get out of their own half due to the home side\\'s eagerness to reduce the 3-1 deficit. Bale stretches his legs by bursting down the right at pace before picking out Ronaldo. However the Real Madrid man\\'s effort at goal is deflected wide by Juanfran. Ramos has now scored six goals this season. A pretty good record for a central defender. Ramos really is a threat from set-pieces. He showed outstanding technique to head past Oblak. Ronaldo almost put his side in the lead, however his shot was cleared off the line by Mario Suarez. Momentum is building for the home side with 24 minutes gone. Sportsmail\\'s Pete Jenson:\\xa0Real Madrid need to repeat Champions League final scored here to go through and there is the first. Ramos from Kroos free-kick after Torres kicked Ronaldo. Curse of the commentator. Sergio Ramos leaps above Atletico\\'s defence to head past Oblak and level the scoring. Game on! Atletico goalkeeper Oblak saves a Ronaldo shot from close range. The Slovenian goalkeeper will have to be at his best if he is to keep a clean sheet. 17 minutes gone and Real Madrid have not really peppered Oblak\\'s goal. Diego Simeone will be delighted with his side\\'s performance thus far. Griezmann, who set up the opening goal, appears to have a slight problem with his arm. Looks like he will be able to carry on though. Torres celebrated his goal in front of the Real fans, who didn\\'t look too happy with the Atletico striker. Atletico are allowing their rivals to dictate play. The pressure is firmly on the home side after Torres\\' opener. Nearly 11 minutes gone at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid now need to score four goals if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the next round. A big task but anything is possible when you have Ronaldo, Bale and Co. Real Madrid will have been shell shocked by the speed of Atletico\\'s goal. Torres, on the other hand, will take great confidence from his first goal since September 23. Fernando Torres has scored his first goal back at his former side inside the first 60 seconds. Griezmann goes on the attack before sliding the ball to Torres, who has the easy tack of placing the ball into an empty net. Ronaldo is currently on the Santiago Bernabeu turf - displaying his Ballon d\\'Or award to his home fans. Rodriguez, Ramos and Kroos are also showing off their trophies for being included in the world team of the year. Sportsmail\\'s Pete Jenson: \\'Mandzukic doesn\\'t even make the bench having not recovered from a virus. Big night for Torres. Needs to stretch Real Madrid on the counter-attack as Ancelotti\\'s team go for the big comeback. \\'Big cheers as Bale\\'s name is read out - Sunday\\'s booing all forgotten. Ronaldo predictably gets the biggest cheer though.\\' Torres makes his second start since rejoining his boyhood side. It would be an ideal place and time for him to score his first goal back at the club. Bale\\'s last match at his home ground saw Real fans jeer the Welsh winger for failing to pass the ball to Ronaldo. The former Tottenham star will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong against his side\\'s rivals. Ronaldo, pictured arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu alongside Marcelo and Rodriguez, will be hoping to show why he was the worthy winner of the Ballon d\\'Or. The Portuguese superstar beat off competition from Messi and Neuer to win the prestigious award on Monday. Sportsmail\\'s Pete Jenson: \\'Madrid supporters packing the streets around the stadium as the team coach arrives at the Santiago Bernabeu. \\'They need to overhaul a 2-0 first leg deficit against Atletico Madrid.

The service was held at Kensal Green Cemetery in west London more than six weeks after the Dundee-born property magnate fell to his death from the balcony of their luxury penthouse. Noelle Reno, 31, joined his daughters Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19, at the service this afternoon, but it appears 52-year-old Mr Young\\'s ex-wife Michelle, 50, decided to stay away. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Tycoon Scot Young\\'s funeral was held at Kensal Green Cemetery in west London yesterday - six weeks after he fell 60ft to his death from the balcony of his penthouse . Paying her respects: Noelle Reno, the former fiancée of tycoon Mr Young, attended his funeral . Heartbroken: Among the attendees at the service this afternoon were hit daughters Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19 . Moving: Mr Young\\'s two daughters had the word \\'Daddy\\' made out of flowers to accompany his body . In attendance: More than 100 guests, including former model-turned-businesswoman Caprice (pictured), who appeared alongside Miss Reno in the reality TV show Ladies Of London, were at the private service . Mr Young, who was said to have had a fortune of £2billion and was involved in one of Britain\\'s most notorious divorce cases, plunged 60ft on to railings outside a £3million apartment last month. His coffin, covered in white roses, was carried in a hearse with flowers spelling \\'Daddy\\'. Relatives arrived in a fleet of more than a dozen luxury cars, headed by two black limousines. Mourners were driven to a private entrance of the chapel for the service which lasted around one hour, before the coffin was driven to the grave site within the cemetery for the burial ceremony. Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8. He had been one of Britain\\'s wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. High profile: Mr Young, pictured (left) with his ex-girlfriend Noelle, became embroiled in one of the  nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with his ex-wife Michelle (right), 50, who accused him of hiding millions . Service: More than 100 guests attended the funeral of Mr Young at Kensal Green Crematorium . In shock: The exact circumstances of Mr Young\\'s death remain a mystery and an inquest will be held this year . Tributes: The flowers and coffin in west London were accompanied by handwritten notes from loved-ones . Close up: Among the tributes, one message read: \\'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet\\'s side\\' Many of the father-of-two’s relatives and friends were driven to a private entrance to the crematorium chapel before his burial at the cemetery. In cold and bright weather, the hearse arrived carrying a mahogany coffin topped with floral tributes, including one made of roses from his daughters, which read \\'Daddy\\'. Among the tributes, one message read: \\'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet\\'s side.\\' Another message said: \\'Dear Scot, missing you badly mate and you will always be remembered.\\' One tribute spoke of their \\'great memories\\' with Mr Young, adding that he was \\'one in a million\\'. After the hour-long service, Mr Young\\'s friends and family emerged from the chapel led by Noelle Reno, the star of Bravo\\'s Ladies of London reality TV show. He also appeared in the first season. Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth \\'a few billion\\'. Family funeral: Around 100 people attended the service held at Kensal Green Cemetery this afternoon . Fall: Mr Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone (above), in the early evening of December 8 . Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs. He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno\\'s apartment in Marylebone. When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently \\'manic, crazy and probably high\\' and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was \\'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend\\' and wanted to \\'grieve in peace\\'. Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.\",\"Scot Young, 52, fell 60ft to his death from £3m penthouse on December 8 .\\nSix weeks on his funeral was held at a cemetery in Kensal Green, London .\\nHis ex-fiancée\\xa0Noelle Reno joined his family for private funeral service .\\nTycoon was once believed to be worth £2bn but lost it all in Russian deal .\\nHe was involved in Britain\\'s most high-profile divorce case with his wife .\\nMichelle Young said he had hid millions  and he was jailed for contempt .\\nShe did not attend funeral but children Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19, did .\"\\n0085473257680f8f27508d3f286e51aaccd0e8d8,\"Outspoken former Apprentice contestant Kate Hopkins - who once said she would never employ an overweight person - has been slammed on Twitter for a \\'vile\\' and \\'ignorant\\' outburst on live TV against overweight people.

Ian Parkes, Press Association . Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season. Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton\\'s thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia\\'s first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco. Centre of attention: Max Chilton remains hopeful of being retained by Marussia for the 2015 season . Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015. \\'I naturally want to stay with the team,\\' said Chilton. \\'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don\\'t really know where you stand until then. \\'I won\\'t focus on that until later on in the year, but I\\'m confident I\\'ll be here next year. I\\'ve had good races this year. \\'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we\\'ve got to the bottom of that. Overall I\\'ve been consistent and had good results.\\' Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. On track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season . Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors\\' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham. If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. \\'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,\\' added Chilton. \\'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. \\'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That\\'s just me really thinking of the bigger picture. \\'I\\'ve not properly looked into it, but I\\'d like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.\\'\",\"Chilton is hopeful of racing at Marussia for a third straight season .\\nBriton\\'s form has dipped in recent races after finishing 13th in Bahrain .\\nBut he is confident of staying at Marussia beyond this season .\"\\n0087fadf3c9f54d10eb0db0b034d0d0c50c494e1,\"President Barack Obama is getting off the island.

The White House had also already announced Obama\\'s plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.

He is seen here on the South Lawn of the White House with daughter Malia . In good spirits: Despite the early return, The President and First Daughter seemed to be enjoying a joke . Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises. Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama\\'s vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas. \\'I think it\\'s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that\\'s why you\\'ve seen the president stay engaged,\\' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Obama returned from his break along with his 16-year-old daughter Mailia, but is scheduled to return to Martha\\'s Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend. In a first for Obama family summer vacations, neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father. Obama left Washington Aug. 9 with his wife, Michelle, daughter Malia, and the family\\'s two Portuguese water dogs. The White House said 13-year-old Sasha would join her parents at a later date for \"\"part of their stay\"\" on this quaint island of shingled homes. But Malia will not be around when her younger sister arrives. The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Obama getting about a week with each one. Malia returned to Washington with her father  and is not expected to go back to Martha\\'s Vineyard. The White House said Sasha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Malia left the island. President Barack Obama bike rides with daughter Malia Obama while on vacation with his family on the island of Martha\\'s Vineyard . Obama often draws chuckles from sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls\\' lack of interest in spending time with him. \\'What I\\'m discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited,\\' Obama told CNN last year. Even though work has occupied much of Obama\\'s first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. Obama\\'s vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan\\'s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama\\'s vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha\\'s Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama\\'s foreign policy. Clinton later promised she and Obama would \\'hug it out\\' when they saw each other at Jordan\\'s party. No reporters were allowed in, so it\\'s not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.\",\"President Obama will head back to the White House on Sunday night as tensions rise in Missouri and Iraq .\\nThe decision appears aimed at countering criticism that the president was spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many crises .\"\\n0089064db0f5619d38cad4aa831cdd32e7616356,\"Texas Governor Rick Perry announced today his intentions to deploy up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to his state\\'s southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico. \\'There . can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too . high a price for the federal government’s failure to secure our border,\\' the Republican Governor said at a news conference this afternoon. \\'The action I am ordering today will tackle this crisis head-on by . multiplying our efforts to combat the cartel activity, human traffickers and . individual criminals who threaten the safety of people across Texas and . America.\\' According to a memo leaked late last night to The Monitor, the executive action will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month. Scroll down for video . Done waiting around: Texas Governor Rick Perry said this afternoon that he is deploying up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the state\\'s southern border, which is also the U.S. border with Mexico . Already, Perry has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to increase personnel in the Rio Grande River Valley area at a weekly cost of $1.3 million. Added together, the two measures will cost $5 million a week, the memo reportedly states, and \\'it is not clear where the money will come . from in the budget\\' other than \\'non critical\\' areas like health care or transportation. The rise in border protection measures follows a surge of Central American children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico. More than 57,000 immigrant children, many of whom are unaccompanied, have illegally entered the country since last year, and the government estimates that approximately 90,000 will arrive by the close of this year. U.S. Border Patrol has been overloaded by the deluge, and the federal government is quickly running out of money to care for the children. Congress is in the process of reviewing a $3.7 billion emergency funding request from President Barack Obama that would appropriate additional money to the agencies involved, but House Republicans remain skeptical of the president\\'s plan. Roughly half of the money Obama\\'s asking for would go toward providing humanitarian aid to the children while relatively little would go toward returning the them to their home countries. Furthermore, Republicans would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that requires the government to give children from non-contiguous countries who show up at the border health screenings and due process before they can be sent home. The judicial process often takes months, and even years, clogging up courts and slowing down the repatriation process. The president had initially planned to include a revised version of the 2008 legislation in his request to Congress that would have allowed the Department of Homeland Security to exercise the \\'discretion\\' to bypass the current process by giving children the option to voluntarily return home. Obama backed down at the last minute after receiving negative feedback from Democratic lawmakers. Perry held a news conference with Attorney General Greg Abbott, right, this afternoon in Austin, Texas, to formally announce the deployment. Perry said the National Guard troops were needed to combat criminals that are exploiting a surge of children and families entering the U.S. illegally . Also not included in Obama\\'s request to Congress was funding for a National Guard deployment to the border - something House Speaker John Boehner and the Texas Governor had both called on the president to do. Republicans say a National Guard presence is needed at areas of high crime to help Border Patrol agents crack down on smugglers and drug cartels. In a face to face meeting with Obama when the president came to Texas two weeks ago Perry again asked the president to deploy the National Guard through a federally funded statue but Obama resisted. Perry is now taking matters into his own hands, sending his own set of troops down to the Rio Grande Valley to aid law enforcement officials. State Senator Juan \\'Chuy\\' Hinojosa, a Democrat who represents border town McAllen, criticized the Republican Governor\\'s deployment as unnecessary. \\'[The cartels] are taking advantage of the situation,\\' he told the Monitor. \\'But our local law enforcement from the sheriff’s offices of the different counties to the different police departments are taking care of the situation. \\'This is a civil matter, not a military matter. What we need is more resources to hire more deputies, hire more Border Patrol,\\' Hinojosa said. \\'These are young people, just families coming across. They\\'re not armed. They\\'re not carrying weapons.\\' The leaked memo on the National Guard deployment specifically denies that it is a \\'militarization of the border,\\' however. And Perry\\'s office reiterated today that troops would \\'work seamlessly and side by side with law enforcement officials.\\' Hinojosa also accused Perry, who recently toured the border with Sean Hannity as part of a special for Fox News, of being insincere in his concern about the situation at the border. \\'All . these politicians coming down to border, they don\\'t care about solving . the problem, they just want to make a political point,\\' he said.\",\"Texas Governor Rick Perry announced this afternoon that he will dispatch up to 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the border .\\nThe deployment will cost Texas taxpayers $12 million a month, according to a leaked memo .\\nPerry has asked Obama multiple times to send the National Guard to the border but Obama keeps refusing .\\nA Texas lawmaker said the Republican governor is not sincerely concerned about the border, he just wants to play politics .\"\\n008926ebc65930f5ff1ddc076941b67cc3ff5fb7,\"By .

Ultimo founders Michelle and Michael Mone negotiated to share personal number plates, computer passwords and a collection of small properties in a bitter divorce settlement, it has emerged. But court documents reveal the pair made a deal not to sell their Glasgow mansion for less than £2.1million and it is still on the market, reports claim. The couple, who created the lingerie brand together in 1996, split in 2011 after Michael, 46, allegedly had an affair with a bra designer. Deal: Court documents reveal Michelle and Michael Mone spent their settlement dividing secret passwords and number plates but agreed to put their entire mansion - and all its possessions - on the market for £2.1m . Venture: The couple founded MJM International, which owns Ultimo, in 1996 after marrying in 1992 . Michelle, 42, raged publicly at her husband for refusing to sell her their baby grand piano and part of their luxurious home. Unable to reach an agreement, they had to put the lot up for sale. The couple demolished the original building, and built \\'Telperion\\', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house. It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland. It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated. Contentious: The pair fought over the luxurious mansion they built together in Thorntonhall, Glasgow . Business: After years of bitter divorce deals, Michelle eventually bought Michael out of their business . The property boasts a vestibule and reception room, drawing room, dining room, dining kitchen, family room, cinema and five bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms. There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers. But according to The Scottish Sun on Sunday, they settled on dividing up other items including their fleet of four personalised cars and their own secret passwords used in the business. Now linked to cricketer Shane Warne and businessman Karl French, Michelle has been embroiled in controversy over student halls being built next to the home where she now lives with her three children. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August.

Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain\\xa0which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims . Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is \\'ruining her life\\' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can\\'t always look after them properly . She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband\\xa0David, 43,\\xa0a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn\\'t strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: \\'I have no idea what I\\'m doing during the fits - it\\'s almost like I\\'m sleep-walking and it\\'s led to some really embarrassing episodes. \\'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.\\' She added: \\'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. \\'I\\'m sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. \\'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. \\'It\\'s mortifying and frankly I\\'m amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.\\' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour.\\xa0But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse . Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily \\'gelastic\\' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or \\'dacrystic\\' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH . Mrs Lyon said: \\'It\\'s terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. \\'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. \\'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating.

Rivera spoke about how Marín physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college, he wanted her to quit school and be at home \"\"cooking and cleaning.\"\" She said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back. They divorced in 1992 when Rivera found out Marín molested their daughter, Janney, and Rivera\\'s younger sister, Rosie. Marín was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Divorced and on welfare with three children, Rivera worked in real estate and took a second job at her father\\'s record label, Cintas Acuario, which led to her passion and career in Regional/Banda/Norteño music. Since the release of her groundbreaking debut album \"\"La Chacalosa\"\" in 1995, Rivera has released more than 12 hit albums, all reaching Platinum and Gold status in the U.S. and Mexico. Her heart-wrenching ballads often center on infidelity, social issues and relationships. One of her independent albums was \"\"Farewell to Selena,\"\" a tribute album to slain singer Selena that helped expand her following. Rivera married Juan López in 1997 and had two children with him: Jenicka and Johnny López Rivera. They divorced in 2003, and he then died in 2009. Then in 2010, Rivera married baseball player Esteban Loaiza but they filed for divorce earlier this year. Perhaps it was her personal struggles that made Rivera known not only for her music but for her strong, resilient attitude when faced with adversity. \"\"In Mexico, she represented a lot of ladies that can\\'t talk about their feelings,\"\" Jose \"\"Pepe\"\" Garza, Rivera\\'s godfather and friend of the family, told CNN en Espanol. \"\"The public feels represented by Jenni Rivera, and by the lyrics of her songs.\"\" Garza is very well-known within the banda and norteña music genres and has worked with other big artists in the regional Latin music. He also gave Rivera her big break. Rivera was also a woman of many firsts. She became the first artist to sell-out two back-to-back nights at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California, in 2010. And she was the first female Banda artist to sell-out a concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California. The business mogul also started companies including: Divina Realty, Divina Cosmetics, Jenni Rivera Fragrance, Jenni Jeans, Divine Music and The Jenni Rivera Love Foundation. Rivera made her film debut at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival with the indie family drama Filly Brown, set to be in theaters in January 2013. Her fan base was only expected to grow with a show in development with ABC, confirmed a source with knowledge of the deal to CNN Entertainment. A multi-camera family comedy, according to Deadline, was expected to star Rivera as a strong, middle-class, single Latina woman working to raise a family, struggling to run a family business and manage her extended family -- all while fighting the cultural perception that she needed a man to do it all. \"\"It is very flattering when they tell me I\\'m a great artist and performer,\"\" said Rivera in a 2010 interview with CNN en Espanol. \"\"But I am a businesswoman, I\\'m primarily business-minded.\"\" Breaking into a male-dominated music genre was not easy, but Rivera made it look that way with her endless perseverance. \"\"I think she just did it with her pantelones, and you need a big personality to do it. She\\'s been through so much,\"\" said Damarys Ocana, executive editor of Latina magazine, in an interview with CNN, \"\"She\\'s been a victim, but never thought of herself as a victim.\"\" The drama that surrounded Rivera\\'s life received just as much attention as her successful, career but that never stopped her from being a \"\"mama bear to her five kids,\"\" said Ocana. Family always came first for Rivera. Flashback: Jenni Rivera reflects on her success . In May 2011, Latina magazine put both Jenni and Janney Rivera on their cover, the first time the magazine put two people on the cover. \"\"We put both of them on the cover because they were the stars of \\'I Love Jenni\\' and the show was doing incredibly well on Mun2,\"\" said Ocana. Rivera also spent part of her life volunteering at the Love Foundation, an organization that promotes programs to support immigrants, children with cancer, women victims of violence, reports CNN Mexico. In 2010, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence named Rivera as their spokesperson. Photos: Singer Jenni Rivera . Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday afternoon, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida described Rivera as \"\"a real American success story.\"\" \"\"She was a singer in a genre of music that\\'s largely dominated by males, and she brought a powerful voice to that genre where she sang frankly about her struggles to give her children a better life in this country,\"\" he said. Universal Music Group also released a statement, saying: \"\"The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Jenni Rivera. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Jenni was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed; but her gift of music will be with us always.\"\" Also believed aboard the plane were her publicist, Arturo Rivera, her lawyer, makeup artist, Jacob Yebale, and the flight crew. \"\"It\\'s hard to accept. It\\'s painful. I cry,\"\" said Rivera\\'s brother Gustavo Rivera in an interview with CNN en Espanol, \"\"But the support from the fans is consoling to us.\"\" She told CNN in 2010 that she wouldn\\'t let scandals or personal tragedy stop her. \"\"Staying defeated, crying and suffering was not an option,\"\" she said. \"\"I had to get off my feet, dust myself off and press on. That\\'s what I want to teach my daughters.\"\" In an interview with the Immigrant Archive Project she said: . \"\"If I had the opportunity to speak to a young immigrant girl that just arrived to the U.S. the advice I would have for her would be: ask, speak, search; because there are opportunities out there. And, know that you aren\\'t the only immigrant or the last to come to this country. Many that have come before you have succeeded. It is possible.\"\" Jenni Rivera is survived by her parents, Rosa and Pedro, three other siblings: Pedro Jr., Gustavo and Rosie; and her five children: Janney, Jacqueline, Michael, Jenicka and Johnny.

David Villa leads the race for the Golden Boot after his fourth tournament goal saw Spain defeat Sweden 2-1. The match had looked set to end in a draw after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalized following Fernando Torres\\' 15th-minute goal. However, a long ball out of defense dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Spain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and certain of top spot after beating both those teams. Torres had put Spain in front when he lunged at a pass from David Silva, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henrik Larsson had shot over the bar and Johan Elmander, who scored against Spain in a qualifying match for Euro 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Stoor curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the area in the 34th minute. The Inter Milan striker turned away from marker Sergio Ramos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Torres put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Silva chipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Joan Capdevila, but Torres stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his 16th goal in 51 appearances for Spain. Larsson and Johan Elmander both had their chances before Stoor found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Stoor\\'s cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Ramos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right-footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 2-0 victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining a hairline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his hat-trick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the 38th minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Elmander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Spain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a nudge on David Silva just before halftime. Markus Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player\\'s swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Spain. Sweden\\'s attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Larsson just failed to meet Petter Hansson\\'s cross at the far post in the 79th minute for his team\\'s best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Silva\\'s rebound in the 63rd minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Torres, whose shot was blocked. The teams seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-meter pass over the head of Torres and into the path of Sweden defender Hansson. However, Hansson lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angled shot from just inside the area. \"\"We\\'re happy. We had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,\"\" said Spain coach Luis Aragones. \"\"In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out.\"\"\",\"David Villa scores an injury time goal to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Sweden .\\nEarlier, Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalized Fernando Torres\\' 15th minute opener .\\nThe win puts Spain in the last eight and guarantees them top spot in Group D .\"\\n00916d7657c98e138640795011f4136014425977,\"By .

Lewis Hamilton has come under fire from his hometown council following \\'derogatory\\' and \\'unfair\\' comments he made about Stevenage in the build up to last week\\'s Monaco Grand Prix. Speaking ahead of the race, Hamilton, who was raised in the Hertfordshire town, claimed he was hungrier than his rival for the Formula One title Nico Rosberg because of his humble beginnings. The Briton, who finished second in Sunday’s race, said: ‘I come from a not-so-great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad’s apartment – and Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats and all these kinds of things – so the hunger is different.’ Under fire: Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by Stevenage MPs for making comments about the town . Humble beginnings: Hamilton grew up in Stevenage with his dad before forging a career in Formula One . But in response to Hamilton’s comments, Stevenage Councillor Philip Bibby said: ‘I can’t see how he can say such things about the place where he grew up. He needs to remember his roots. ‘The council runs numerous schemes with the aim of providing opportunities for all our young people – from the academic through to the athletic and artistic types. His comments are unfair.’ Howard Burrell, Stevenage’s representative for young people, culture, sport, and leisure, added: ‘I think Stevenage is a great place to grow up and there was no need for Lewis to be so derogatory in his comments. It’s where he came from, after all. ‘I would prefer it if he chose to highlight some of the benefits of coming from our town as he is, without question, the most successful sportsperson we have ever produced. There is no need to say such things about his home town.’ Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points after the German secured victory around the streets of Monte Carlo in this most intense of championship battles. The relationship between the two childhood friends hit rock bottom in the principality after Hamilton believed Rosberg had cheated his way to pole despite the race stewards clearing the German of any wrongdoing. Best of enemies: Hamilton (left) admitted he and team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) are no longer friends . A seething Hamilton admitted after the race that he is no longer friends with Rosberg, but Mercedes Toto Wolff believes the intensity between his two drivers is to be expected. ‘It’s an intense relationship but this intensity is normal,’ said Wolff. ‘The racing philosophy of Mercedes is to allow our drivers to compete; we let the boys play with their toys unless they break them.

Geologist Michelle Coombs monitors the Redoubt volcano from the Alaska Volcano Observatory. \"\"This is kind of the nerve center, if you will,\"\" says geologist Michelle Coombs, who is at the helm of a bank of video monitors showing readouts from sensors on Mount Redoubt, a volcano about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. The sensors measure seismic activity on the volcano\\'s summit. Scientists at the observatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. \"\"We\\'re seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,\"\" says Coombs. \"\"As that magma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also it gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activities were seeing now.\"\" When the magma, or molten rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt. A siren goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire. Is the mountain erupting?  Learn more about Mount Redoubt » . \"\"That\\'s just a little alarm. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,\"\" Coombs says reassuringly. \"\"It\\'s a special kind of earthquake particular to volcanoes called a long-period earthquake. It has more to do with fluid and gases than with breaking rock.\"\"  Watch Coombs keeping an eye on Redoubt » . Since the monitors first showed increased activity on January 23, the observatory has been staffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Lower 48 have been making their way north to help. Coombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. No one lives near the mountain, which sits on the Cook Inlet and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. \"\"Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,000 feet above sea level,\"\" says Coombs. She notes that at current weather conditions, \"\"it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage.\"\" The ash is composed largely of silica, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines. But it is usually a nuisance. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets. \"\"For jet aviation, it\\'s a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica-rich ash gets ingested into the engine, it can remelt and coat the insides of the engines and freeze up those engines,\"\" says Coombs. \"\"That\\'s really the major thing we are trying to avoid here.\"\" The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalled. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Coombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren\\'t blaring, Coombs sends out the official Twitter feeds from the observatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months\\' pregnant. \"\"People have been joking, \\'Are you going to name him redoubt?\\' \"\" she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitors.\",\"In the cold Alaskan winter, geologist keeps watch on Mount Redoubt .\\nMichelle Coombs thinks the volcano will erupt within days or weeks .\\nThe biggest danger could be ash getting in a jetliner\\'s engines .\\nAt Alaska Volcano Observatory, they\\'re getting extra help, monitoring 24/7 .\"\\n00971e34b7c8fb70119ac5c1886bf024b020dca1,\"(CNN) -- A leading international children\\'s charity has warned that Elton John\\'s desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday. The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday. \"\"David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn\\'t be fair for the child,\"\" he told reporters. \"\"But having seen Lev today, I would love to adopt him. I don\\'t know how we do that but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David\\'s heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home. I\\'ve changed my mind today.\"\" While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message. James Georgalakis, EveryChild\\'s Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: \"\"Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life. \"\"So it\\'s quite well documented that these high-profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions.\"\" Do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing? According to research by the charity\\'s Web site, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine\\'s institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children\\'s homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV. It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Soviet-era children\\'s homes. \"\"After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new \\'gate-keeping\\' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution,\"\" Georgalakis said. \"\"So when a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support. \"\"We will definitely be speaking to Elton and his representatives about this.\"\" Elton John is the latest high-profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Malawi. Critics of the pop-star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of \"\"archaic adoption laws\"\" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James. Madonna\\'s initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. This condition was waived when Madonna -- and then husband Guy Ritchie -- adopted her first Malawian child, David Banda. The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency. Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in UK each year, with many facing a considerable wait. BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: \"\"While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family. \"\"We\\'ll certainly be reinforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year.\"\"\",\"Elton John, 62, made announcement during a visit to an orphanage in Ukraine .\\nEveryChild charity believes international adoption sends wrong message .\\nSpokesman: Mothers abandon children in hope they are adopted by foreigners .\\nMadonna recently won appeal to adopt second child from Malawi .\"\\n009a362400a857382e1556a5f4d862e02ee25a50,\"QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has insisted his club can afford not to win promotion to the Premier League, despite debts of £177.1 million.

Vladmir Markin, a spokesman for the country\\'s federal investigation agency, told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti that both explosions were terrorist attacks. \"\"This strike, which was cynically planned for the period of preparations for New Year\\'s celebrations, is one more attempt by terrorists to open a domestic front, sow panic and chaos, and trigger religious strife and conflicts in Russian society,\"\" said a statement Monday by Russia\\'s Foreign Affairs Ministry. \"\"We will not back down and will continue our tough and consistent offensive\"\" against terrorists, the ministry\\'s statement said, adding that such an enemy \"\"can only be stopped by joint efforts\"\" involving the international community. The approaching Olympics . No one claimed responsibility for the Volgograd blasts, but they occurred several months after the leader of a Chechen separatist group pledged violence to disrupt the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics that begin on February 7. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the bombings as \"\"a despicable attack on innocent people. \"\"The entire international movement joins me in utterly condemning this cowardly act,\"\" Bach said in a statement, adding that he wrote Russian President Vladimir Putin to express condolences as well as \"\"our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure Games in Sochi.\"\" Meanwhile, the United States offered its \"\"full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games,\"\" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. \"\"We would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,\"\" Hayden said. Volgograd is a major rail hub in southern Russia and a main transit point for people traveling by train to Sochi on the Black Sea, just over 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the southwest. Each day, thousands of passengers use the station in the city once called Stalingrad. Two blasts in two days . Video footage from the scene Monday showed the twisted shell of a blue trolleybus, with debris spread around it. The impact of the blast blew out the roof of the bus, as well as windows of several nearby houses. At least 28 people were reported to be wounded, with several in serious condition, including one 6-month-old child, RIA Novosti reported. Based on the footage, the blast appeared to have occurred in the back half of the bus. The federal investigation agency said it believes the explosion was set off by a male suicide bomber. Investigators said the train station blast Sunday also appeared to have been caused by a suicide bomber. Markin told RIA Novosti that DNA testing will be carried out on the remains of the station bomber, who used the equivalent of 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of TNT in a device containing shrapnel. Investigators said they also found an unexploded grenade at the scene. Video taken from an outside security camera showed a huge fireball inside what appears to be the main entrance of the three-story stone building, followed by a steady trail of smoke coming out of shattered windows. Russia\\'s security challenge . In July, Doku Umarov, the leader of the Chechen group Caucasus Emirate, released a video statement in which he vowed to unleash \"\"maximum force\"\" to disrupt the games at Sochi. The U.S. State Department considers the Caucasus Emirate a foreign terrorist group and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of Umarov. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the 2011 bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. In October, a bomber blew up a passenger bus in Volgograd, killing six people and wounding more than 30 others. Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for that attack. \"\"Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan,\"\" RIA Novosti reported Monday. The two young men behind the Boston Marathon bombings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack. \"\"Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,\"\" Rajan Menon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column. What might be behind the attacks? Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored. \"\"This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the Games because of the myriad layers of security,\"\" Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told CNN on Monday. Other parts of Russia . However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policing the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan. With tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia. RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometers) east of Sochi. \"\"Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, \\'We\\'re going to try and disrupt these games,\\'\"\" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Monday. \"\"When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you\\'ve got to take them at their word.\"\" The fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is \"\"not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,\"\" she added. Athletes are \"\"most vulnerable\"\" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said. Townsend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings. They\\'ll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.\",\"U.S. legislator says spectators will face tight Olympics security .\\nRussia\\'s foreign ministry vowed a continued \"\"tough\"\" offensive against terrorism .\\nTwo terrorist bombings hit Volgograd, killing more than 30 people .\\nThe attacks raised concerns about security at the Olympics in February .\"\\n009b92670e692dfa2056a70aad8fed9cff643346,\"After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Elena, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. The siblings arrived earlier in the day at the Wild Animal Sanctuary, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, officials said. The lionesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds zoo in La Chorrera, outside Panama City. The sanctuary helped rescue the lionesses at the behest of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. The lionesses, at 200 to 225 pounds, weigh about half of what they should. \"\"Nobody really took care of them,\"\" Craig said. \"\"They got no medical attention.\"\" Non-governmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The lions usually were housed in a 6-foot-by-8-foot concrete and steel cage in a zoo at the fairgrounds. \"\"These three girls didn\\'t have a family structure,\"\" Craig said. \"\"It was more or less that they were isolated for (nearly) 15 years.\"\" Wednesday afternoon, they were in a 1,500-square-foot temporary area at the sanctuary. \"\"They are in their enclosure, and they are resting comfortably,\"\" according to Craig. \"\"They are enjoying the space.\"\" He expects that the lionesses will eventually join a pride of African lions that were rescued in Bolivia. \"\"African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together,\"\" Craig said. One of the big cats, Elena, is named for Elena Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescues in Panama. On several visits to the zoo, Castejon noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst. The carnivores, she said, largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance. Zoo visitors often bothered the animals and rattled their cages in the wee hours of the night. \"\"It was horrible,\"\" she said. Castejon credits ANAM with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds. The zoo also featured gnus, deer, crocodiles and turtles. After a protracted legal battle, the zoo was closed, with a mountain lion, two jaguars and an ocelot being temporarily cared for at Summit Zoo in Panama City. Jorge Garcia, a biologist and wildlife technician with ANAM, said the animals were being kept without proper permits. Over two weeks, La Chorrera hosts one of the biggest fairs in Panama, Garcia said, with school groups visiting the zoo the remainder of the year. Because groups that sponsored the fair and zoo changed every two years, he said, it was difficult for the government to force organizers to make improvements. It\\'s important for government and animal rights groups to work together, Garcia said. \"\"We need to make alliances.\"\" In February, 25 lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia were flown to the Colorado sanctuary, where they live uncaged. The flight, part of an Animal Defenders International operation, followed the passage of a Bolivia 2009 law that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The sanctuary built an 80-acre fenced site for the Bolivian lions, which are split into four prides, Craig said. \"\"They all have practically doubled their weight\"\" in the past seven months. The 720-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses about 300 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. Most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That\\'s largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so they won\\'t go into heat. That also reduces the competition and fighting among males. FedEx carried the felines from Panama to Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday and then to Denver early Wednesday.\",\"Three sister lions are rescued from zoo at fairgrounds in Panama .\\nUnderweight siblings lived in a small concrete and metal enclosure .\\nThey were flown to animal sanctuary in Colorado .\\nThey already can hear the roars of other big cats .\"\\n009bc4ed85ee998f320502ab3138d5f18bec0f90,\"Acid attack victim turned TV presenter Katie Piper has announced her engagement.

She posted the tweet on Saturday morning where she told fans she is due to be married after proposal last night . It is thought the pair dressed up for a romantic evening and a three-course dinner at their home in London yesterday. She posted a picture on Instagram last night of her meal of baked cod capers, cooked by her now fiance and father of their baby daughter, Belle Elizabeth, who was born in March this year. Alongside the pictures she wrote: \\'Pretending we are going out for dinner! Cooking 3 course meal, dressed in our best clothes- all taking place at our kitchen table! Parents night in/out #nobabysitterneeded.\\' With her second snap she posted: \\'I think my boyfriend has potential as a chef! Baked Cod with Capers,\\' before making the big announcement on Twitter today. The presenter posted this image on her Instagram last night where she told fans she was enjoying a three course meal at home with her boyfriend . Katie gave birth to baby daughter Belle Elizabeth in March this year. Her due date was Thursday, March 27, 2014 - the date of the six-year anniversary of when she was raped by her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch . The couple met after being set up by friend Juliet, who gave James her number. They shared their first phone call, which Katie admits was \\'nervous and stilted\\' but they soon started to relax, telling each other about their jobs. The pair arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema.\\xa0\\'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere,\\' Katie said. \\'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either. \\'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.\\' Katie, pictured at the TV Choice Awards in September, left, and at the Pride of Britain Awards in October, right . The couple soon started dating and became official before finding out they were expecting a baby in March, this year. Katie was just 24 when her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch organised for a man to throw industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. At the time, her modelling career was taking off and she had recently been crowned Miss Winchester in a beauty pageant. She had also begun presenting on small digital television channels, primarily shopping channels, and decided to leave her parents\\' home in Hampshire for the capital. It was here she met Lynch - a martial arts enthusiast - who had been tracking her media and modelling career closely. In October, the acid attack survivor was awarded an honorary degree at Anglia Ruskin University, in Chelmsford, Essex (left) and right pictured earlier this year . He approached her on Facebook and the pair decided to meet up in person in Reading, where Katie was working at the time. But two weeks into the relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater following a meal out, where Lynch raped, beat her and stabbed her several times in the arms. After eight hours in the hotel they drove back to her flat in Golders Green and she later sought medical treatment, though she was too scared to tell doctors what had really happened. Two days later, he persuaded her to go into an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account, where outside her flat she was approached by a man in a hoodie. She thought the man - Stefan Sylvestre, who Lynch hired to carry out the attack - was going to ask for money but instead he threw the liquid in her face. Katie, pictured before the attack left, and right during her recovery after she had acid thrown in her face . Katie has gone on to present television programmes, while her ex Danny Lynch has been jailed for 12 years . Writing in the Daily Mail after the attack, she said: \\'When the large cupful of acid hit my smooth, soft, line-free skin, trickling down my throat and partially blinding me, he almost succeeded in extinguishing the last of the old Katie. Almost. \\'In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships I’d ever had, trying to ingrain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss. \\'I was sure I’d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved.\\' The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences - Lynch will serve a minimum of 12 years. She has since endured more than 100 operations to rebuild her face and set up the Katie Piper Foundation to raise awareness of the issues facing burns victims. Katie has also taken part in a number of documentaries and written her autobiography.\",\"Katie Piper made her \\'exciting\\' announcement this morning on Twitter .\\nJames is believed to have proposed at their London home last night .\\nShe posted pictures of a three course meal and her dressed up yesterday .\"\\n009c6499ac040e30a18b547bb153f180255ba8f6,\"(CNN) -- The family of a U.S. citizen who was detained last week in North Korea said Monday they are \"\"anxious for his return,\"\" according to a written statement.

City\\'s deficit of £97.9 million ($158 million) for 2011-12\\'s Premier League-winning campaign was just under half that of the £197.5 million ($318 million) for the previous period -- which was the biggest loss in soccer history. The latest figure represents the fourth highest deficit in the English game -- three of which belong to City since the arrival of its Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. It can be contrasted with the $37 million net profit made by rival Manchester United in 2011-12. United posted a reduced revenue of £320 million ($517 million) for that period, while City closed the gap with a club-record turnover of £231.1 million ($374 million). Both are substantially behind leading Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona. Chelsea boosted by first profit in Abramovich era . It was the first time that City had breached the £200 million ($323 million) mark, and reflects the club\\'s attempts to become more self-sufficient and avoid possible punishment from UEFA for failing to meet FFP targets. However, owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed still injected £169 million ($273 million) in order to keep the club debt free. \"\"It is important to recognise the personal and ongoing influence of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on the rapid transformation that is taking place,\"\" said chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak. \"\"The hard work of everyone involved at Manchester City over the last four years has begun to create an obvious momentum.\"\" Last season City won the English title for the first time since 1969, and made a debut appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Manchester United seeks to cash in as sponsor DHL is sent packing . The club\\'s revenue would have been higher if not for a group-stage exit from Europe\\'s top club competition -- which has been repeated already this season -- but new chief executive Ferran Soriano was satisfied with the results. He joined City in September, having previously helped transform the financial fortunes of Barcelona between 2003-08. \"\"What I have found is a club on the verge of a historic transformation, reinforced by a genuine commitment to doing things well. It is a club with a rich history and the potential for an even brighter future,\"\" he said. With the FFP rules coming into play from next season, City officials are under pressure to conform -- or face the possible expulsion from European competition and a withholding of prize money. A 10-year stadium rights deal with Etihad Airlines -- owned by Abu Dhabi\\'s royal family -- which also includes the club\\'s under-construction campus has considerably boosted City\\'s balance sheet. It is building an academy to try to avoid paying over the odds for star players in the future -- the £201.8 million ($326 million) wage bill for 2011-12 made City the first English club to break £200 million in salaries, according to the Sporting Intelligence website. That equates to more than $890,000 a day. \"\"The City Football Academy will strengthen the club\\'s youth development and training capabilities, enable more players to move through the Academy and Elite Development Squads into the first team in the future, while bringing all of the club\\'s operations together on a single site within the Etihad Campus,\"\" Khaldoon said. \"\"The responsibility lies with all of us to continue the hard work that will ensure that this is only the beginning of a long and successful era for Manchester City.\"\"\",\"English champion Manchester City posts loss of $158 million for 2011-12 season .\\nIts revenues rose to a record $374 million after winning title and playing in Champions League .\\nOwner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed injected $273 million to keep the club debt free .\\nCity paid more than $325 million in player wages -- the first English club to reach that level .\"\\n009e7d73f3131b3d814ba6599858be4f2d69ddfb,\"By .

Residents in Hastings, East Sussex were kept waiting for the grand unveiling of the mystery star, with rumours circulating that local celeb and Madness frontman Suggs would be making an appearance. But their excitement was soon dampened when Chesney Hawkes was revealed as the guest to open the Christmas stalls and ice rink. People in seaside town Hastings, East Sussex, were left fuming after the \\'celebrity\\' booked to open a Christmas market and festive ice rink was unveiled as one-hit-wonder Chesney Hawkes . Locals have now launched a Go Away Chesney campaign and took to the internet to vent their anger. One person tweeted: \\'90s legend. Will . be a bit long in the tooth by now – we’re planning a Go Away Chesney . protest when he arrives here – if anyone can recognise him.” Another wrote: \\'Is this a joke?! If not, not exactly pushing the boat out.\\' Singer Chesney Hawkes has been revealed as the celebrity to open the Christmas market in Hastings, much to the dismay of locals . Hastings boasts several other singers and celebs who were either born in the town or live there now, who have had scores of hits, such as Graham McPherson, Suggs from Madness. Madness spent 214 weeks in the charts between 1980 and 1986 - the most of any band in the UK in the 80s - with hits like Baggy Trousers and Our House and have multiple platinum albums. Erasure singer Andy Bell, who lives in Hastings, sold more than 25m albums worldwide, with hits including A Little Respect, Always and Chains of Love. Other celebs with links to the seaside town include pop guru Simon Fuller, who was born in Hastings, Have I Got News for You funnyman Paul Merton and comic Jo Brand. Simon Mills, 43, said: \\'Hastings has a long line of celebrities, including Suggs and Andy Bell, so why in the world would Chesney Hawkes be chosen to open the Christmas market?\\' Another local called Wendy said: \\'Is this the best we can do? \\'Why couldn\\'t we have Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart? Or even good old Cliff? \\'The one and only Chesney Hawkes? - you said it mate.\\' Chesney, 41, is best known for his number one hit The One and Only, which topped the charts in 1991. Although Chesney has since dabbled with fame he now plays gigs at freshers week events at universities around the UK.

Striker Higdon, 31, headed his first on 86 minutes from Jose Baxter’s cross and added his second four minutes later with a shot into the bottom left-hand corner to snatch a dramatic victory. MK Dons’ two brightest young prospects, both of interest to Premier League clubs, had combined to put their side ahead.

Subs not used: Turner, McGinn, Kennedy, Dimaio. Booked: Alcock, Baxter. Scorer: Higdon 86, 90. Man of the match: Delle Alli. Referee: Roger East 6. Delle Alli, the 18-year-old starlet with a wealth of admirers in high places, enticed a foul in the box with an electric run before Benfik Afobe, 21, an on-loan Arsenal striker confidently netted from the spot for his sixth Capital One Cup goal of the season. Alli lit up the second round as MK Dons dispatched Manchester United 4-0. This fourth-round tie had little of the magic of that occasion but Alli again showed why he is being courted by the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal. MK Dons breakthrough came in the 66th minute when Alli was brought down by Craig Alcock and Afobe coolly slotted home. It was a rare moment of quality until the dramatic late finish. If one action summed up a lacklustre first half it was United defender Robert Harris’s free kick from 25 yards out in the 40th minute which he lamely lifted high and wide. MK Dons started brightly, with Afobe coming close to connecting with a looping ball into the box from Tom Flanagan in the second minute. Afobe admitted wanting to impress Arsene Wenger, ahead of his contract running out at the end of this season. Holding midfielder Alli looks a classy prospect and linked up well with Afobe. Alli sparkled in the second half, skipping away from challenges and creating space for his teammates. But it was the United who dominated the opening stages of the second half. Clough shook his head in disbelief as his side failed to score in the second minute after the break when a group of players in the box lunged for the ball but missed the chance to score. Clough again had head in hands when Stefan Scougall headed over by he was dancing with joy at the final whistle thanks to Higdon’s heroics. There was plenty of grabbing and grappling in the box in the second minute of the second half when several Sheffield United players were held by MK Dons defenders. This went unpunished by referee Roger East.

Voters in Alaska received a letter this weekend from the \"\"Alaska State Voter Program,\"\" which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question: . \"\"WHAT IF YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS, AND YOUR COMMUNITY KNEW WHETHER YOU VOTED?\"\" Despite the official-looking letterhead, the \"\"Alaska State Voter Program\"\" isn\\'t a government initiative. The mailer came from the conservative Opportunity Alliance PAC, which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election, the Alaska Dispatch News reported Monday. And the political group says it will follow up after the election, with plans to send out a new mailer that lists which voters went to the polls on Nov. 4. \"\"You and your friends, your neighbors, and other people you know will all know who voted and who did not vote,\"\" the group writes in the letter. The mailer could have an impact on the crucial Senate election in Alaska next week, where Republican Dan Sullivan is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps. One recipient of the letter told the Alaska Dispatch News she was creeped out when she realized she was Facebook friends with the 11 people listed in the mailer she received. It\\'s not the first time groups have tried to shame voters into heading to the polling booth. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, sent voters in Virginia a \"\"report card\"\" last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box-- and their next-door neighbor\\'s. \"\"You are one of the few individuals in your neighborhood that is not a regular voter. We\\'re contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who doesn\\'t vote\"\" the AFP letter reads, according to local NBC affiliate WWBT. \"\"Your neighbors who have voted in every election are concerned about our community\\'s well being. They\\'re concerned about the future of America...Are you?\"\" Voters in other states have received similar \"\"report cards.\"\" Another group, Values are Vital, sent Florida voters a mailer this spring that even graded their attendance record at the ballot box and also shared their neighbors\\' voting track record.

The mother of a teenager who was killed when a friend crashed his car just four days after passing his test has spoken of her shock after the driver was jailed for only 12 months. Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control of his silver Renault Clio on a 60mph country road and smashed into a tree, killing front seat passenger Mikey Maguire, 19. Sadler had previously been convicted of a . string of serious motoring offences and twice banned from the road . before he even had a licence. He was seen on the night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns and showing off in a car park. Sadler . pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced . to 12 months in jail and banned him from driving for five years. Afterwards Mr Maguire’s mother Allison Jarman, 43, described the sentence as an ‘insult’. She said: \\'When I was in court my head was in my hands and at one point I couldn’t even listen to what was happening. \\'I . expected the sentence to be low because I have been doing a lot of . research online but when I heard it was 12 months it felt like a slap in . the face. \\'Nothing can . bring Mikey back but 12 months for my son’s life is shocking.

I always said he would end up hurting someone one . day, I just didn’t expect it to be my son.\\' The fatal crash happened on Huntick Road, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, Dorset, on February 8 last year. Sadler, from Poole, lost control of his . car on a bend before it ploughed down a grass bank and struck the tree. Mr Maguire was pronounced dead at the scene. Victim: Mikey Maguire pictured on on holiday with his mother Allison, who described the sentence as an \\'insult\\' to her son\\'s memory . Sadler had previously been disqualified from driving after being convicted of two counts of aggravated vehicle taking. He appeared in court for one of the counts and driving without a licence and insurance in July 2010. In both incidents he lost control and caused more than £5,000 damage to one of the vehicles. Les Smith, defending, read out a statement from Sadler to Bournemouth Crown Court in which he expressed ‘regret and sorrow’ for the Mr Maguire’s death. He added: \\'The incident haunts me every day and will do for the rest of my life.

Carl Becker, 87, and his wife Barbara Becker, 81, were asked to leave the fast-food restaurant by a manager on February 21 in Culpeper, Virginia. The elderly couple, who have visited the chain for years, had apparently overstayed their welcome and were told to get out of the restaurant, which was half-empty in the mid-afternoon, so an employee could clean under their table.

There was a full house at Kings-holm on Sunday but the mood of festive cheer in the renowned Shed was soon wiped away. The hosts were desperate to atone for the emphatic loss at the hands of Bath at the same ground eight days earlier but instead they slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five home games in the Aviva Premiership. What was once an intimidating stronghold has become far too welcoming. Man of the match Andy Goode kicks one of his two penalties to add to his three conversions for Wasps . Wasps hit back with Tom Varndell providing the pass for Christian Wade to cruise in for their first try . While Gloucester remain ninth with persistent problems to address, Wasps have risen to sixth after their first victory on the road since beating Worcester on March 21. First-half tries by Christian Wade, Tom Varndell and Nathan Hughes came as an astute kicking game spread panic in the Cherry-and-White ranks. Despite Gloucester’s stirring second-half fightback, Wasps held on to claim a win which was arguably more significant even than the success on their first outing at the Ricoh Arena last week. Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We got the monkey off our back. Coming into this we’d won all our home games and lost all our away games. It was nice to get that away victory. ‘In the first half we controlled the game and I was really pleased. At half-time we talked about things we needed to do in the second half and we pretty much did none of them. We turned over the ball eight or nine times and put ourselves under pressure. We were really poor. ‘But I was pretty pleased with how we closed the game out. We found a way to win. It gives us confidence to go away and grind out a victory, especially in the last five minutes because I’ve lost count of how many games we’ve lost in the last five.’ Gloucester\\'s England centre Billy Twelvetrees is tackled by Wasps\\' Ben Jacobs . Jonny May initially reaches just short of the line but continues his move to chalk up Gloucester\\'s first try . England wing May composes himself on the slide before putting the ball down in the corner . Gloucester\\'s Scotland international Greg Laidlaw kicks one of his two conversions - he also kicked three penalties at Kingsholm in the one-try loss . Wasps half-backs Andy Goode and Joe Simpson had Gloucester in disarray with their aerial onslaught in the first half, but only after Jonny May had given the home side a first-minute lead. When James Hook’s cut-out pass reached Mark Atkinson, he picked out England wing May, who cut inside to score and Greig Laidlaw converted. What followed was grim viewing for the Shed as their heroes unravelled in defence. In the ninth minute, Varndell broke through Steve McColl’s tackle on the flank and offloaded superbly for Wade to go over from close range. Goode’s conversion began his flawless return which yielded 12 points from three conversions and two penalties. In the 20th minute, the veteran fly-half’s high kick into the 22 bounced awkwardly behind Charlie Sharples and Varndell was able to gather and surge past the flailing McColl to touch down. There was a powerful riposte as Gloucester’s pack rumbled forward from a lineout for Matt Kvesic to strike but they were soon exposed again at the other end, in identical fashion, as the Wasps eight drove Nathan Hughes over to score. Varndell then bagged a five-pointer of his own after picking up a speculative kick from Andy Goode . Wasps turned down a kickable penalty before Nathan Hughes finished off a strong line-out drive . After a dressing-down at half-time, the home side rallied strongly and three penalties by Laidlaw brought them back to within a point on the hour. But there was to be no glorious comeback as Goode and Elliot Daly struck late penalties. Gloucester’s director of rugby David Humphreys said: ‘At the start of our year, one of our targets was to make Kingsholm a difficult place for teams to come but our recent results here haven’t backed that up. ‘After another home defeat, the long-term plan doesn’t seem as important as getting short-term results. We all know we are in a results business and we want to win. But we also know we have good players and there are aspects of our game that are improving. We are four months into a long-term project. The fans know that we’re not where we want to be, but they realise that we are a work in progress.’ John Afoa, Gloucester’s World Cup-winning All Black prop, delivered his own damning assessment, adding: ‘It was really disappointing. You look at the body language of the boys — really down and out. We let another game slip through our fingers. We are down in confidence. Maybe some guys are not making the right calls.’\",\"Jonny May and Matt Kvesic scored Gloucester\\'s two tries at Kingsholm .\\nWasps\\' five-pointers from Christian Wade, Tom Varndell, Nathan Hughes .\\nMan of the match Andy Goode converted all three and kicked two penalties .\"\\n00a57bef588a7e7efd0438fba62f07356c59b036,\"A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of its iPhones to encourage users to buy a new release.

A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of iPhones to encourage users to buy its new release. The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for \\'iPhone slow\\' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases . The study, compiled by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco, follows claims that the Cupertino-based company is deliberately sabotaging its old products. Writing for the New York Times, Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, described the results as \\'striking\\'. \\'Wouldn\\'t many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one?\\' Mr Mullainathan wrote. ‘When you sell the device and control the operating system, that\\'s an option\\'. The study then compared those results with similar searches for the term \\'Samsung Galaxy slow\\', and found the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung . While some MailOnline readers haven\\'t noticed a slow down, others claim that Apple is sabotaging older phones through software updates. \\'This is common knowledge,\\' one reader wrote. \\'If you want to keep your iPhone running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out within six months of a new iPhone release,\\' Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product. She said her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Ms Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Her claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one. And Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before. Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product . A security expert has warned Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the \\'Hackers on planet Earth\\' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm\\'s software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user\\'s address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. However, Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes. His investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a ‘backdoor’ in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem. Meanwhile, in 2012 Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly. Ms Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. ‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. Dom Ferkin, managing direction of UK-based iOS experts, Creation Application, told MailOnline that he doesn’t believe Apple are doing this intentionally. ‘On every hardware release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time they are released,’ he said. ‘Each year they release a new iOS. If you’re running an iOS 7 on a 5 chip, for example, it’s comparable to running Windows XP on a Windows 95 machine. ‘It’s just enough to annoy the users, but it’s needed if you want the slew of new features that Apple releases each year.’ Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong. No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn\\'t allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower. There are other explanations for why an older model iPhone may slow down, he claims. For instance, the latest version of the Apple operating system, iOS, is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as efficiently on older models. ‘Hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone,’ he added. ‘And you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.’ Apple is yet to respond. But Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong.No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn\\'t allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower .\",\"The study was undertaken by student Laura Trucco at Harvard University .\\nIt also compared Apple\\'s results with searches for \\'Samsung Galaxy slow\\'\\nResearch found that the term was unaffected by Samsung new releases .\\nStudy has fuelled suggestions Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’\\nTheory states that manufacturers build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one .\"\\n00a6c0823ba92e5a055d90133e8b66fa9028c2d7,\"By .

A week before, a similar protest -- though in a chilly drizzle, not on a warm, sunny day -- drew about 250. And a month of frustration, desperation and anger boiled over at Tokyo Electric Power Company\\'s headquarters Friday as officials from towns around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant demanded to know when the crisis that has besieged their farming communities would end. \"\"The nuclear plant situation needs to be resolved as soon as possible. If not, we farmers will die,\"\" one of the officials, Iwao Suzuki, told the utility\\'s executives. But the response from Naomi Hirose, the managing director of Japan\\'s largest utility, offered little encouragement to the delegation or the rest of the world. \"\"There is a need to draw an end to the current situation as soon as possible,\"\" Hirose said, adding, \"\"We totally agree to this and are taking the utmost endeavors to contain the radiation.\"\" Since the March 11 earthquake that ravaged northern Japan, workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been struggling to cool down three overheated reactors and keep pools of spent but still potent nuclear fuel from spreading further radioactive contamination across northern Japan. A month into the crisis, the utility acknowledges, there is no end in sight. The problems are so far \"\"beyond the design capacity\"\" of the plant that the Japanese are working in uncharted territory, said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. \"\"No nuclear power plant has ever considered the inability to get on long-term core cooling for more than a week, much less three weeks,\"\" Friedlander said. Some Japanese experts now say the effort is in danger of failing unless Japan seeks more help from international experts to bring it to an end. Tetsunari Iida, an engineer-turned-industry critic, said the situation is \"\"beyond the reach\"\" of Japan\\'s closely knit nuclear establishment. \"\"A real exit strategy has to start with an inspection by the world\\'s top experts on nuclear accidents,\"\" Iida told reporters at Japan\\'s national press club last week. Engineers and workers so far have managed to stave off a complete meltdown in Fukushima Daiichi\\'s reactors 1-3 and in the spent fuel pool of unit 4. But experts say the overheated fuel rods are likely to have suffered extensive damage, and there is a complication for seemingly every advance. Much of the past week was dominated by the attempt to stop water laced with massive amounts of radioactive particles from pouring into the Pacific Ocean -- water that comes out of the reactors \"\"screaming with radioactivity,\"\" Friedlander said. Tokyo Electric is now grappling with where to put the stuff, even dumping thousands of tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific to make room for it in a reservoir for low-level waste. In a normally functioning plant, coolant water is circulated out of the reactors and chilled. Then it\\'s pumped back in to carry more heat away from the plant\\'s fuel rods, which continue producing energy long after the chain reaction at the heart of the units has been stopped. \"\"You have to get the recirculation system up and functioning so they can cool that water in the normal way,\"\" said Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan and a CNN consultant. Normal cooling systems don\\'t require the massive amounts of water -- around 7 metric tons (1,850 gallons) per hour -- now being poured into the reactors. \"\"That\\'s a big problem,\"\" Was said. Tokyo Electric officials told CNN they can\\'t say when they\\'ll be able to restore those normal cooling. The first step is to get highly radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the units\\' turbine plants, then figure out how badly the equipment inside has been damaged. For the first two weeks of the crisis, engineers pumped seawater into the reactors. But the resulting buildup of salt inside has made it harder for coolant to circulate, U.S. nuclear safety officials advised in March. In addition, Was said, the fuel rods are likely in a state of \"\"partial melt,\"\" the extent of which will be difficult to determine. After 1979\\'s Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, it took more than two years before operators were able to get a camera into the reactor to examine its condition, he said. Satoshi Sato, a Japanese nuclear industry consultant, called the current line of attack a \"\"waste of effort.\"\" Plant instruments are likely damaged and unreliable because of the intense heat that was generated, and pumping more water into the reactors is only making the contamination problem worse, he said. \"\"There is no happy end with their approach,\"\" Sato told CNN. \"\"They must change the approach. That\\'s something I\\'m sure of 100 percent.\"\" After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world\\'s worst to date, the Soviet Union encased the plant\\'s damaged reactor in a massive concrete sarcophagus. Iida said Fukushima Daiichi\\'s reactors remain too hot to pour concrete, but he suggested pouring a slurry of minerals and sand over them to carry away heat before encasing them. And Was said the reactors have to be cooled in order to let the molten fuel harden again: \"\"Only when it solidifies are you sure you can contain it.\"\" He said Tokyo Electric should be in the lead -- \"\"It\\'s their plant\"\" -- but he added, \"\"There\\'s a lot of different areas in which they could benefit from international help.\"\" Japan\\'s government is consulting with experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the French nuclear fuel company Areva, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of Japan\\'s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the agency\\'s chief spokesman. U.S. Navy barges have been carrying fresh water to Fukushima Daiichi, and Tokyo\\'s foreign ministry has asked Russia about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. \"\"We already have quite a bit of support from outside countries and organizations,\"\" Nishiyama said. But he added, \"\"I think the most urgent issue now is support in whatever form possible with regard to how we can dispose of the cooling water and be able to build a sustainable cooling system.\"\" General Electric which designed the reactors, and Hitachi, which built most of the plant, are also advising the government and Tokyo Electric. GE chief Jeffrey Immelt flew to Japan to consult with Japanese officials and executives last week, and Tokyo has asked Russian officials about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. But for now, Japan has \"\"no choice\"\" but to continue pouring water into the reactors, Friedlander said. \"\"I have no doubt that the men and women working at the power plant are indeed going to exert every human effort to make sure that they resolve this,\"\" he said. \"\"What I don\\'t know and what I can\\'t tell and the big question mark for me is, will it be done sooner than later? \"\"And again, my hope is, is that it\\'ll be done sooner. But in order for it to be done sooner, TEPCO\\'s going to have to step up and ask for more help from the international community.\"\" Ailing Chang and CNN\\'s Brian Walker contributed to this report.\",\"No timetable has been crafted for restoring normal cooling, Tokyo Electric says .\\nExperts say Japan and Tokyo Electric need help resolving the crisis .\\n\"\"There is no happy end with their approach,\"\" a Japanese analyst says .\\nIt\\'s too early for a Chernobyl-type solution, a CNN consultant advises .\"\\n00a79ca59be700e845bf9e90bf08c5106b4a72bb,\"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- On April 20, President Obama challenged his Cabinet to cut $100 million in spending over the next 90 days.

At time the challenge was announced, critics said $100 million in savings was a small amount on the context of the federal budget. \"\"Any amount of savings is obviously welcome,\"\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in April. \"\"But [$100 million is] about the average amount we\\'ll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year.\"\" In April, Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort. \"\"Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money,\"\" Gibbs said. The issue is a sensitive one for Obama at a time of fierce Republican criticism about increased government spending for the economic stimulus plan.

Kim worked with Mackay at Cardiff City before the manager was sacked by  Malaysian owner Vincent Tan in December 2013 amid a storm of racist, sexist, anti-semitic and homophobic text messages in which he was implicated. The Football Association are still investigating the messages retrieved when files were seized from Iain Moody, Cardiff’s former sporting director, who resigned from his position at Crystal Palace when Sportsmail revealed the scandal in April 2014. Kim Bo-kyung says he is looking forward to working with Wigan manager Malky Mackay again . Among them were the use of the term ‘chinkys’ — in direct reference to the arrival of Kim — and a joke about Koreans eating dogs. The situation got worse when Wigan chairman Dave Whelan spoke about ‘chingalings’ as he defended his decision to appoint Mackay back in November. But Kim expressed his delight at being reunited with Mackay following his medical at the DW Stadium. The 25-year-old said: \\'I am very happy to be joining up with the gaffer again. \\'I really enjoyed working with him in the past and he helped me so much in my career. He gave me the chance to fulfil my dream of playing in England and I am now looking forward so much to working with him again. \\'Since becoming a free agent, we had various offers but when the chance came to be with the gaffer again at Wigan, this really was the only place I wanted to come. \\'The other players have all made me welcome already. The atmosphere in the dressing room seems very good, there is a nice feeling with all the lads and we now have to keep working hard to pick up as many points as we can and start climbing the league table.\\' Wigan manager Mackay has signed South Korea winger Kim as a free agent . Kim worked with Mackay at the South Wales club before the manager was sacked by owner Vincent Tan . Mackay came in for heavy criticism last year when the League Managers’ Association issued a statement describing the text messages as ‘friendly banter’, but the 42-year-old Scot later issued a full and unreserved apology. It was reported last week that he is likely to be cleared by the FA, who are believed to have a policy of not being able to act on communications sent privately between two individuals. Wigan, deep in the Championship’s relegation zone, sold Ben Watson, Shaun Maloney, Adam Forshaw and Callum McManaman during the January transfer window, which closed on Monday night. Mackay signed Leon Clarke on loan from Wolves and Sheyi Ojo on loan from Liverpool, and also snapped up the Cameroon defender Gaeten Bong on a short-term deal. His latest signing, Kim, scored his first top-flight goal in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United in November 2013, but has appeared just twice in the Championship this season and had his contract cancelled by mutual consent on January 24. The 25-year-old has won 30 caps for his country and was handed the No 7 shirt following the retirement of South Korea legend Park Ji-sung, but missed out on a place in the squad for the recent Asia Cup, in which they lost a thrilling final 2-1 to Australia in Sydney.\",\"Kim Bo-kyung has joined Wigan Athletic until the end of the season .\\nThe 25-year-old is reunited with former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay .\\nBo-kyung: \\'I am very happy to be joining up with the gaffer again\\'\"\\n00aa8e3ba59f5fe71a096a5549f80faece10aa83,\"A windy storm sweeping down the West Coast knocked down trees, ripped through freeway and street signs, delayed hundreds of flights and knocked out power for thousands of people in California and Nevada.

The money will be invested in Bombardier\\'s new C Series aircraft, which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers. Bombardier faces obstacles, including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis, which has hit the aviation industry hard. But the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been \"\"under-served\"\" by the major players, Hachey said. Watch: How to buy planes . \"\"So far, we\\'ve been serving customers up to about 100 seats, more in the regional segment. Now we\\'re cracking into more of the mainline segment. We\\'re investing about $3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment,\"\" he told CNN. \"\"If you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $10 billion on the rail side and $10 billion in aerospace. But it is a major bet for the corporation.\"\" Cutting edge design . Hachey said Bombardier\\'s competitive edge lies in the design of its planes. Until now, this market had largely been served by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. However these smaller versions of planes -- called \"\"shrinks\"\" --- were also much heavier. The other option was Brazilian company Embraer\\'s E-195 -- known as a \"\"stretch\"\" -- but it cannot fly as far in one go. In comparison, Hachey said Bombardier\\'s C Series will deliver an \"\"optimized product\"\" built specifically for the 100 to 150-seat market. On its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient, yet provide a \"\"best-in-class, wide-body cabin environment.\"\" Taking on the major players . Bombardier\\'s ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high, given the long history of Airbus and Boeing in these markets. Founded in 1942, Bombardier is a relatively new kid on the aviation block. The company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer. Its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people, with an annual turnover of Â£8.6 billion. According to Hachey, the company now has the scale to take such challenges. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit . Hachey is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat segment over the next 20 years. So far Bombardier has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft. Hachey, who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes, said: \"\"We feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards, so we are very happy with our position.\"\" Beyond Europe . As European markets continue to take a battering, Hachey says Bombardier will be expanding its focus elsewhere. In the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries, with a renewed push in the U.S. \"\"In Europe typically things have been slower than usual, and this is a fortress market for us. We\\'ve been very strong in Europe so we are feeling the impact of the economic uncertainty,\"\" Hachey noted. Watch: Airlines brace for economic impact . \"\"The good thing is the rest of the world is not necessarily in the same shape. If you look at emerging countries we\\'ve been doing very well,\"\" he said. \"\"We\\'re focusing elsewhere.

The twisters caused major damage to about 60% of Mapleton, a city of about 1,200 residents, Monona County Sheriff Jeff Pratt told reporters Sunday. It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight, originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa. But despite causing extensive damage, it did not lead to any fatalities, said Stefanie Bond, a spokeswoman for Iowa\\'s Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. Wildfires in Texas | Flooding in upper Midwest . Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas. Initially, concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community, which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City. By 5 p.m., people were being allowed back in, though authorities remained on the scene, according to the sheriff\\'s department. The high winds tossed cars and tractors, tore off roofs, caused a car wash to collapse, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries, giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere. \"\"There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town, but no fatalities,\"\" the sheriff said. Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County, according to a statement from his office. The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help. He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County, which also suffered severe damage. He then toured the tornado-ravaged town on Sunday afternoon, posting pictures online of uprooted trees and conversations with residents. On his Twitter page, Branstad wrote, \"\"Please keep the victims in your thoughts and prayers.\"\" The twisters struck just before midnight Saturday. Amateur video recorded by storm chasers shows a large funnel cloud spinning across a flat terrain outside Mapleton. In the background, a passenger can be heard exclaiming, \"\"It\\'s going to hit that town! ... Mapleton\\'s in big trouble!\"\" Did you witness the storm? Share your story . Afterward, National Guard troops were brought into the area, according to Stefanie Bond, a public information officer for the state\\'s Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. She also said that natural gas service was temporarily shut off in the city. The Red Cross was also on the ground providing assistance. Bruce Spence, a government liaison for the group, called the damage to the town \"\"extensive.\"\" \"\"The whole town is without power.

There\\'s debris all over, trees are down. \"\"This isn\\'t going to get fixed soon,\"\" Spence said. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night. At least three of the twisters, including the Mapleton tornado, caused significant damage, according to Boksa. In Early, a town of 1,600 residents, a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries in that town. In Schaller, a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles, the weather service reported. Tammie Pech, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims. Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday, Spence said. Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends, he said. The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha, possibly from a tornado. Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country, in central Iowa, and Kossuth County, in the east along the Illinois border. Three cities in Fayette County -- Fayette, Westgate and Maynard -- were without power for about an hour Sunday evening due to a blown transformer, the state\\'s emergency management spokeswoman said. Randy Frank, Fayette County\\'s homeland security and emergency management coordinator, said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through, with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening. \"\"Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control,\"\" said Frank, whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County. \"\"And it\\'s that way across the state, with the wind, which (can) be very dangerous in (fanning) the fire.\"\" CNN\\'s Greg Morrison, Greg Botelho and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.\",\"NEW: A Fayette County official says fuel fires, fanned by strong winds, are a concern .\\nMapleton had been shut down as authorities probed a possible gas leak .\\nA Red Cross liaison calls the city\\'s Main Street \"\"a disaster,\"\" with debris everywhere .\\nOther Iowa communities are also hit hard by overnight twisters .\"\\n00ac91a5794537f1f37a8962a41fea6dbea2779b,\"He’s famed for being one of the greatest living singer songwriters and now Sir Paul McCartney has turned his hand to rapping. The former Beatle – a passionate vegetarian – recorded the rap video in an attempt to persuade people to stop eating meat one day a week in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint and help fight climate change.

The former Beatle - a passionate vegetarian - recorded the rap video in an attempt to persuade people to stop eating meat one day a week . The 51-second video begins with a simple message directing people to pledge their support to the Meat-Free Monday petition . But it quickly descends into a cringeworthy performance as the Beatles singer starts to wave his hands and click his fingers . But it quickly descends into ‘Dad-rap’ territory as he begins to put on an accent along with animated hand gestures, finger-clicks and hand claps. Sir Paul, 72, made the plea for people to go vegetarian once a week before the UN climate summit, which takes place today in New York. In the video – which runs under the hashtag ‘#MFMclimatepledge’ - he says: ‘I need your help, all I want you to do is just log in on pledge.meatfreemondays.com and pledge your support to the idea of meat-free Monday. ‘I need your help - please do it. We’ll send all these pledges to the politicians, and then they’ll do something about it.’ He then ends by repeatedly rapping the web address for the organisation in an accent, saying: ‘Pledge.meatfreemondays.com, pledge.meatfreemondays.com. You can do it right now please.’ Sir Paul has spoken out against the meat industry in the past which he says is a major contributor to climate change. More than 843,000 people – including the likes as Gwyneth Paltrow, Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Spacey and Ricky Gervais – have signed up to the Meat-Free Monday pledge . The Meat-Free Monday movement stems from the idea that cutting out animal products from the human diet can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Drivers travelling from Gatwick who entrust their cars to firms close to the airport might want to check the credentials of the company before handing over their keys. Gatwick Airport parking firm Gold Parking is one firm which has allegedly been revealed to be a \\'rogue trader\\' by BBC1 programme Watchdog. The BBC says the parking company was caught leaving holidaymakers\\' cars in random locations such as side streets and even town centres when they assumed they were being parked in a secure car park. A parking firm taking Gatwick Airport passengers\\' cars to \\'secure parking\\' allegedly left them on side streets (File pic) One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned . The internet site for Gold Parking describes the company as \\'the most affordable and convenient Meet and Greet Parking Company at Gatwick Airport\\' and claims, \\'All our compounds are 24/7 manned\\'. One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned, while another reported that their Mercedes had been stolen. The show\\'s presenter Matt Allwright and his team secretly checked to see whether the firm had a secure car park by providing three fake customers who handed over cars to Gold Parking. The customers were charged £90 for one week and £150 for two weeks to have their vehicle taken to the company\\'s \\'secure car park\\', but on each occasion the cars were left out in the open in Crawley, in communal public carparks, outside shops and in a residential side street. Exposed: Gold Parking, exposed by Watchdog on the BBC parked some cars in the Three Bridges Community Centre . Secure? Other cars were parked in a residential road in Crawley called Thatcher Close . Gatwick Airport has an approved list of parking firms and Gold Parking is not one of them . Crawley residents told the BBC they often saw unfamiliar vehicles left in the open for days on end. The BBC show, which aired last Wednesday, featured Dipesh Toor, who left his £45,000 Mercedes with Gold Parking and returned to find it had been stolen. The company told Watchdog it did have access to a secure compound which it shared with other companies. It claimed Mr Toor\\'s Mercedes was stolen from within this car park. Brenda Jones left her Audi A7 with Gold Parking while on honeymoon in Cuba, and when she returned found the car was dirty, had a ripped tyre and an extra 1,500 miles on the clock. The couple subsequently received a parking fine in the post, stating the vehicle had been parked in a residents\\' parking space without a permit and two weeks later another fine arrived for a pay and display space. TravelMail was unable to contact Gold Parking on repeated occasions, and its website has been removed.

But exactly how many years does that foundation, mascara and\\xa0 blusher knock off? Now research suggests that when applied well, it can make the wearer look almost a decade younger. The beauty myth: Respondents to the survey said Carol, 51, looked 53 with no make up, but just 46 - seven years younger - when she chose to wear a full face of cosmetics . Madonna, 54, took seven years off her \\'bareface\\' age . Demi Moore, 49, lost six years thanks to make-up . Those who go out in their warpaint appear to be between five and nine years younger than when they are bare-faced. Kate Moss, 38, and Carol Vorderman, 51, were shown to have the most age-reducing regimes, with both looking nine years younger after applying make-up. Meanwhile, 54-year-old Madonna managed to shave seven years off her age and Cindy Crawford, 46, took off six. The research – which you won’t be surprised to hear was conducted for a beauty retailer – involved showing respondents images of well-known women, first bare-faced and then with make-up. Respondents were asked to identify a ‘make-up age’ and a ‘bareface age’, with the collective results making an average for each. Britney Spears, 30, managed to look five years younger with make-up on. Demi Moore, 50, was the only woman whose ‘bareface age’ was below her real age at 47 – but with make-up on she looked even younger, at 43. Respondents were also asked about their own make-up, with 70 per cent of over-30s saying it makes them look younger. 100 per cent of 60-69 year olds say they look younger in make-up . and... 73 per cent of 40-49 year olds . 62 per cent of 30 - 39 year olds . Of that, 36 per cent thought that make-up made them look one to three years younger, while 29 per cent thought it could make them look three to five years younger. An optimistic 2 per cent thought make-up took ten years off their real age while 18 per cent thought it took off five to seven years. Only women under 21 thought that a slick of black kohl and some lipstick actually added a few years. The survey by Escentual.com showed that the older you are, the more reliant you are on make-up to turn back the clock. Only 60 per cent of those aged 30 to 39 thought they looked younger with make-up, compared with 100 per cent of those aged 60 to 69.\",\"A full 100 per cent of 60 to 69 year olds thought that make-up made them look younger .\\nCarol Vorderman, 51, looks 53 bare-faced - but 46 with full make-up .\"\\n00af3b469010e46f154734cfba77bb001791517f,\"By .

With their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - National Trust venues seem like the perfect family day out. But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes. In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country. The National trust has its eye on a different audience at the Killerton estate in Devon . Vintage: The National Trust hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd . The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences. To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’. Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame. ‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’ Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’ The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year . Two models pose on a vintage car. The trust hopes to give off a less \\'buttoned-up\\' impression of its properties . The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes . Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50. The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure. Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district. It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’. Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image. She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’ ‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’ The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive. This is where the organisation\\xa0 has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays.\",\"Charity to host racy performances at 18th Century Killerton House in Devon .\\nHopes to improve organisation\\'s \\'buttoned-up\\' image .\\nInsists there will be no nudity - only \\'corsets, feathers and pearls\\'\"\\n00afa094e59946ddc8129b36146e416c02109030,\"By . Anne Hamlyn . There\\'s a bitter battle being fought on the High Street between retail titans Marks & Spencer and John Lewis. What are they fighting over? Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it. Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis\\'s spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S\\'s, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable. Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict... John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140 . M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55 . Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection. Yes, they\\'re a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it.  You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work.  And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night. These trousers would be \\xa0flattering whatever your\\xa0size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you\\'d sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection.  I\\'m not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version. These are creased even on the hanger and they\\'re cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women.  One good thing is that they\\'re properly lined, so at least your knickers won\\'t show through the white fabric. Personally, I\\'d spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59 . M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59 . Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success.  The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it\\'s limp on the hanger, so it\\'s going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap. On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They\\'ve designed them with women\\'s curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S\\'s strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive.  The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they\\'re almost the same price. However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there\\'s too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side? WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers . John Lewis: Dress, £89 . M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35 . The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It\\'s beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape.  The nautical look isn\\'t overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman. Nautical stripes aren\\'t a particular trend for 2014, but they\\'re a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look\\xa0well. Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It\\'s too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy.  The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the\\xa0seams.  Yes, it\\'s cheap, but I just can\\'t see many people looking good in it. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com . M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com . At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them\\xa0on.  Though a fitted, white dress isn\\'t the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible. The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette.  Then there\\'s the M&S version, which I really don\\'t like.  Yes, they\\'ve picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it\\'s clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps.  Then there\\'s that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered. I\\'m surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20.  I can\\'t for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it.  And the final blow is that it\\'s more than double the price of John Lewis\\'s version. My advice is to steer clear. WINNER: John Lewis . John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59 . M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75 . The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it\\'s even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line. It\\'s a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I\\'d say these will be on the sale rail before long. I\\'m also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top. I don\\'t think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store\\'s normal range, there\\'s often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una. The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It\\'s not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I\\'d wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look. WINNER: M&S .

A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled \\'I\\'ll kill all of y\\'all\\'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering\\'s sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police.

But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon.

The incredible video was shot in Arnhem, Netherlands, when it was blighted with flooding after the river Rhine burst its banks. The low-lying Netherlands has been fighting back water for more than a thousand years when farmers first built dikes to protect their land. Now a complicated network of canals and pumping stations cover the country keeping it high and dry. But as this video shows, a bit of flooding is nothing the Dutch can’t handle. The news comes as a British pensioner caused chaos on the M1 motorway by riding his scooter the wrong way down the hard shoulder.

The Serbian is doing to Nadal what the Spaniard did to Roger Federer a few years ago -- despite their age difference of a mere 11 and a half months, it looks to be a case of out with the old king and in with the new. Djkovic turns 24 next Sunday on the eve of his bid to win a first French Open. He ended Nadal\\'s two-year winning run on clay in Madrid last weekend, and this time he thwarted the Mallorcan\\'s bid for a sixth Rome title in seven years. His aim will now be to stop Nadal collecting a sixth French Open crown, and add to his own tally of two grand slams -- both coming in Australia, this year and in 2008. Djokovic also won the Rome title three years ago, but he was unable to maintain his momentum. In 2011, however, he is within striking distance of John McEnroe\\'s record best start of 42 successive wins set in 1984. As in the match against Murray, the final at Foro Italico was a see-saw affair with both players breaking each other\\'s serve unexpectedly often -- but Djokovic had the power and precision when it counted most. Serbian\\'s No. 1 dream is fast becoming a reality . He took a 5-3 lead in the opening set after an uncharacteristic miscue by Nadal, then dropped his serve and promptly returned the favor to take a 1-0 lead. He went 2-0 up in the second set but Nadal, winner of a record 19 Masters Series titles, showed he is far from a spent force by battling back to level and keep it that way until the 10th game. Djokovic went 40-0 up but Nadal saved three match-points -- but the five-time Rome champion could not escape the fourth one and fell to just his second defeat in the tournament. \"\"He\\'s doing amazing things, he\\'s very tough mentally and physically,\"\" Nadal said. \"\"Every week he\\'s winning matches, he\\'s playing fantastically, he\\'s doing a lot of things very well and he has a lot of confidence.\"\"\",\"World No. 2 Novak Djokovic five wins away from matching John McEnroe\\'s record .\\nSerbian beats top-ranked Rafael Nadal 6-4 6-4 in final of Rome Masters .\\nDjokovic has defeated the Spaniard in four successive title matches .\\nNadal is top seed and defending champion for the French Open starting in a week\\'s time .\"\\n00b2c695b7e98960539f962e7e99c20616382314,\"By . Kelly Strange . PUBLISHED: . 10:55 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:57 EST, 18 October 2013 . A woman has spoken of the heartbreaking moment she was told she was infertile because she had unprotected sex with one partner as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, was undergoing exploratory tests in hospital to find out why she and her fiancé had been unable to conceive a baby when she was given the devastating news that she may never be a mother. She was stunned to be told her infertility had been caused by an STD she had contracted and been treated for as a teenager. Jodie Watson, 21, caught chlamydia when she was 16. When she started trying for a baby with her fiancé James Jackson, 30, she found the disease had left her infertile . Now, as she struggles to raise money for IVF, Ms Watson has made the brave decision to talk about her heartbreak in the hope that it will stop other teenagers from repeating her mistake. She said: ‘I was young and I made one foolish mistake that I will pay for forever. ‘That single mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life and I want other young women to know that when they have unprotected sex they are dicing with their future and their fertility. ‘My dreams have been destroyed because of something that happened five years ago but I want to talk about it to stop it happening to anyone else.’ Ms Watson thought she was being sensible when she protected herself against pregnancy before sleeping with a partner when she was 16. But after going for an STI test she was told she had contracted chlamydia. She was treated with antibiotics and put it behind her. She says: ‘I’d learned a horrible lesson at a young age, but what young woman doesn’t make mistakes? ‘I put it behind me and vowed it would never happen again.’ Ms Watson had treatment when she was 16 and thought she was cured. When she struggled to conceive tests revealed her fallopian tubes were irreversibly damaged . But Ms Watson was unaware that the damage had already been done. It wasn’t until she met James Jackson through her work in a care home, that she was to discover just how much her life had been affected by one mistake. The couple quickly became serious and Mr Jackson proposed. When they moved into their own home in Hartlepool, County Durham, the couple started trying for a baby. But after a year with no joy Jodie saw her GP in April 2012. Ms Watson and her fiancé are now trying to raise the money needed to pay for IVF treatment . Blood tests came back normal so she was referred to a gynaecologist in June 2012. She underwent a series of ultrasounds and X-rays in October 2012, which revealed blockages in her tubes. Ms Watson said: ‘I was stunned when they told us what they had found, but was not prepared at all when they said it was usually caused by chlamydia. I hadn’t even told James about it because it had happened so long ago, I thought it was in the past.’ But now it was affecting her future dreams of motherhood and Ms Watson was told she was infertile. ‘I broke down and cried. I just couldn’t believe it. I was ashamed, embarrassed and shocked. ‘I thought because I had been treated I would be fine but the consultant said the damage had likely already been done. I had no idea.’ Their only hope of a family lies in IVF but as Mr Jackson had a daughter with an ex-partner the couple do not qualify for treatment on the NHS. After being dealt the bombshell Ms Watson suffered with depression. She said: ‘I was just blaming myself every day and wishing I could turn back the clock.’ After researching her condition she read about an operation, which could help to unblock her tubes and increase her chances of becoming pregnant. Her GP explained there was just a 15 per cent chance it would work but gave the go ahead. Ms Watson underwent the operation in January this year but has still not become pregnant. Ms Watson wants to raise awareness about the dangers of unprotected sex as she says she regrets her decision every day and doesn\\'t want other teenagers to make the same mistake . ‘They managed to partially unblock the right tube but the left was too badly damaged,’ she explains. ‘There is still a tiny chance I might fall pregnant so I cling to that but I know deep down the only real chance is likely IVF.’ Ms Watson applied to take part in an egg sharing scheme but was rejected because of the STD. At between £4,000 and £6,000 per cycle the couple are now fundraising to pay for IVF. She says: ‘After the bills there is hardly anything left to save so I’m doing what I can to raise the money including car boot sales. Ms Watson has also started a Facebook page to spread her warning to as many teens as possible. Ms Watson said: \\'Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak\\' ‘I think it’s unfair that I don’t qualify for help on the NHS because my partner already has a child. That shouldn’t stop me from being a mum. I would like to see that rule reviewed. ‘Every day I regret the decision I made as a teenager but I know there are likely hundreds of other teenagers doing the same and I want to save them this heartbreak. ‘I know there are people who will judge me, but we all make mistakes and nobody regrets it more than me. ‘I wish I had never had unprotected sex and I wish I had known the full extent of the damage that can be caused. ‘I’m praying for a miracle and hope that one day I will get the chance to be a mother. ‘In the meantime I will do what I can to help other women by raising awareness.’ If it is not treated, chlamydia can cause long-term problems. In women it can spread to the womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes - this can cause a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility and persistent pelvic pain. It also increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydia can also spread to cause inflammation in the fallopian tubes - this can make it difficult for an egg to travel from the ovary to the womb making conception more difficult. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis - swelling of the part of the man\\'s reproductive system that carries sperm from the testicles. If left untreated, it can lead to infertility.\",\"Jodie Watson caught chlamydia from a partner when she was 16 .\\nShe was treated with antibiotics and thought she was cured .\\nWent for tests when she and fiancé James Jackson struggled to conceive .\\nTests showed her fallopian tubes were blocked as a result of the chlamydia .\\nThe couple are now fundraising to pay for IVF treatment .\\nThey are not entitled to IVF on the NHS as Mr Jackson has a daughter from a previous relationship .\"\\n00b3cebdfa5caccbddb4c701689e2dfddd89a3d4,\"Oscar Pistorius may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her, South African police believe. Detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Reeva Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’. This and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’. South African police are investigating whether Oscar Pistorius beat his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home . Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria. Police have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. Prosecutors have formally charged Pistorius with premeditated murder but the Blade Runner’s family say he firmly denies such a charge. Yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend Justin Divaris shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him: ‘There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva.’ Mr Divaris rushed to the house, where he said Pistorius repeatedly told him: ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ While no officials would comment publicly on the case, a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in Pistorius’s home started to emerge. Neighbours have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am. There were some suggestions, quickly denied, that the row may have been about Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with a rugby player. At around 3.20am, four shots rang out – apparently not all at once. The first person Pistorius called was his father Henke, 59. Shock: Pistorius appears in court charged with premeditated murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home . When he arrived, he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie-clad girlfriend down the stairs. She had been shot in the head, hip, . arm and hand. Pistorius – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to . save Miss Steenkamp’s life. Police reportedly found the bloodied . cricket bat in the bedroom. The en-suite bathroom door was riddled with . holes, a pistol holster was found by Pistorius’s bed and a gun cartridge . was on the floor. South Africa’s City Press quoted an . unnamed police source as saying: ‘The suspicion is that the first shot, . in the bedroom, hit her in the hip. She then ran and locked herself in . the toilet. ‘She was doubled over because of the . pain. He fired three more shots. She probably covered her head, which is . why the bullet also went through her hand.’ The source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat. While one scenario is that Pistorius . attacked Miss Steenkamp with the wooden bat, it has also been claimed . that the model may have used it to defend herself. Rugby star Francois Hougaard\\'s agent said the \\'sad ordeal\\' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok\\'s friendship with Miss Steenkamp . A third possibility is that Pistorius . used it to break down the bathroom door. Those close to Pistorius have . suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘save’ his dying girlfriend. According to this theory, the athlete . first shot Miss Steenkamp by accident, whereupon she fled to the . bathroom. He then shot at the door lock to try to get in, accidentally . killing her. Pistorius’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes. While he admitted that he had not . talked to his son in detail about what happened, he said he had ‘zero . doubt’ that the sportsman thought Miss Steenkamp was an intruder. A more likely defence from Pistorius is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her. Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics . Some in South Africa have speculated . about the nature of Miss Steenkamp’s friendship with Springbok rugby . player Francois Hougaard, and whether this played a part in the tragedy. The 24-year-old was keen to distance . himself from such reports at the weekend. His agent said: ‘This whole . sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him.’ Last night Pistorius’s agent said he had withdrawn him\\xa0 from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him. The tragedy has also cast fresh light on Pistorius’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry. Miss Steenkamp\\'s father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at \\'a complete loss\\' As well as owning a pistol and . machine gun, at the time of Miss Steenkamp’s death he reportedly had . seven outstanding firearm licence applications. One was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent Sandy Hook school massacre in the US. Pistorius, who was charged with . premeditated murder at a court appearance on Friday, spent the weekend . in a police cell ahead of a second hearing planned for tomorrow at which . his lawyers are expected to ask for bail.

A new study says smoking ordinances can lead to fewer hospitalizations from heart attacks. Researchers studied the impact of smoke-free ordinances implemented in Pueblo, Colorado, in July 2003. They compared the number of hospitalizations for heart attacks 18 months before the policy went into effect and three years after implementation. The Pueblo Heart Study found that although 399 people were hospitalized for heart attacks before any smoke-free laws went into effect, that number dropped to 237 three years after the law\\'s introduction, a 41 percent decline. The study was published in the CDC\\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Wednesday. The accompanying editorial suggests that there may be several reasons the ordinance may have led to a reduction in the number of heart attack-related hospitalizations: . • The ordinance led to an immediate decrease in secondhand smoke exposure. • People who were forced to comply with smoke-free rules in public may have adopted a smoke-free environment at home and thus reduced the exposure to secondhand smoke even more. • Restrictions to where you can smoke may have led more people to quit smoking altogether. While the Colorado researcher didn\\'t know if the study participants were smokers or non-smokers, the CDC\\'s editorial points out that the new study adds to research from eight other studies, which also saw a drop in heart attack related hospitalizations after smoke-free laws are enforced. A 2006 Surgeon General report concluded that \"\"exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer.\"\" According to the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society, secondhand smoke is the combination of two types of smoke that is produced when burning tobacco: the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or pipe and the smoke that is exhaled by the smoker. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human cancer-causing agent. According to the cancer institute, there is no safe level of secondhand smoke, and it can have an immediate effect \"\"on a person\\'s heart and blood vessels.\"\" It may raise the risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths annually, according to the NCI Web site.\",\"Researchers studied effects of anti-smoking ordinances in Colorado .\\nHospitalizations for heart attacks went down 41 percent, study found .\\nEditorial suggests several reasons for possible correlation .\"\\n00b4cdefd9bc4dcdd55a6162f0d61e16d1b8ae8d,\"An Illinois Congressman was escorted off the floor of the US House after he wore a hoodie as he gave a speech condemning the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Rep Bobby Rush, a Chicago Democrat, is the latest high-profile figure to don a hooded sweatshirt to protest racial profiling and discrimination. The garment, which the Florida 17-year-old was wearing when he was killed last month, has become a political statement for protestors, who believe Trayvon was targeted for being a young black man wearing a hoodie. Scroll down for video... Protest: Illinois Rep Bobby Rush removed his suit jack to reveal a hoody underneath and put the hood over his head as a symbolic show of support for Trayvon Martin . Out of order: Rush was quickly escorted away from the podium and as the acting speaker slammed down his gavel . The Congressman\\'s protest comes as it was revealed Trayvon\\'s girlfriend, 17, had to be hospitalized when she learned that she was the last person to talk to him before his death, according to Radar Online, citing an anonymous source. Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on the phone as he walked back to his father\\'s home after picking up Skittles and a iced tea. Days after the shooting, following Trayvon\\'s wake, his family\\'s lawyer spokes with the girl to get information about what she heard. When he informed her she was last person to speak to him alive, she became \\'absolutely inconsolable and had trouble breathing so her mother took her to a nearby hospital emergency room,\\' the source told Radar Online. In Washington, Rush took the podium wearing a suit coat. Halfway through his speech Wednesday morning, he took off the jack, revealing a gray sweatshirt underneath, and put the hood over his head. Hallowed halls: Rush (lower left) was led away after acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper (center) began pounding his gavel and called Rush out of order . Political statement: Hoodies have become symbols of racial profiling and discrimination, protestors say, after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed while wearing one . Justified? George Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon in self defense after being attacked by the teen . \\'Just because someone wears a hoodie, does not make them a hoodlum,\\' he said. The . acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, began . bagining his gavel and ruled Rush out of order almost immediately. Rush was escorted away by staffers. The US House has a longstanding policy against wearing hats on the floor. \\'I . applaud the young people all across the land who are making a statement . about hoodie, about the real hoodlums in this national, especially . those who tread on our law wearing official or quasi-official cloaks,\\' he said, according to the Washington Post. Rush, who represents a district on the south side of the Chicago that is 65 percent black, is no stranger to high-profile symbolic gestures. In 2004 he was arrested, along with other Congressmen, for trespassing at the Sudanese embassy during a protest of the Darfur genocide. He was a civil rights leader throughout the 1960s and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. In 2008, he warned Senators that refusing to seat Rolland Burris, who was appointed by scandal-plagued Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich, was tantamount of lynching. In 2009, he sponsored a bill that would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic rifles to register for federal firearms licenses, one of the strictest gun control proposals in recent years. Hoodies are standard attire for the . thousands of people who have marched in cities across the country . demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman. New York state senators wore hooded sweatshirts at the state legislature earlier this week as a shot of support for the protestors. The hoodie escalated as a political symbol when Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera said: \\'I’ll bet you money that if he didn’t have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn’t have responded in that violent and aggressive way.\\' He later added to the fury by saying: \\'If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word.\\' The comments sparked outrage and helped fuel the anger of protestors, who turned them into a symbol of support for Trayvon.

Zimmerman, . a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, has not been arrested for . killing the unarmed teenage February 26 in a gated community in Sanford, . Florida, because he claimed the shooting was self-defense. However, . it was revealed Tuesday that the lead homicide detective wanted to . charge Zimmerman with manslaughter in the teen\\'s death after questioning . him for several hours at the police station. The local state attorney\\'s office stopped the arrested, saying they didn\\'t believe they could win a conviction because of Florida\\'s Stand Your Ground law. Zimmerman claimed to police Trayvon punched approached him and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. He said the teen then climb on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times. Zimmerman said he feared for his life when he pulled out his Kel-Tec semi-automatic 9mm pistol, which he was licensed to carry, and shot the teen in the chest at very close range. Speaking out: Trayvon\\'s parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son\\'s death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday . Under state law, a gun owner can open fire if he has a reasonable fear of being killed or severely injured by an attacker. A local grand jury, a the Florida State Attorney\\'s Office and several federal agencies are all investigating the case to see whether the killing was, indeed, lawful. The federal agencies are also looking into whether the case is a hate crime after a 911 call surfaced with Zimmerman muttering a word that was possibly a racial epithet. The information about Zimmerman\\'s possible arrest comes as new information about Trayvon has begun to paint a different picture of the teen. School records from the Miami Herald reveal he was suspended from high school three times -- once for truancy; once after he was caught carving graffiti and a school administrator discovered he had a \\'burglary tool\\' and bag full of women\\'s jewelry; and a third time when he was caught with a marijuana pipe and an empty baggy with drug residue. The conservative news site the Daily Caller dug up a Twitter account that it claims belonged to Trayvon.

All week! Occupy Wall Street!\"\" they chanted. Combelic called the mayor\\'s announcement a \"\"not-so-veiled attempt\"\" to force protesters from the park, setting up a possible confrontation with authorities. Protesters descended on the privately owned park near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to protest the nation\\'s ailing economy. \"\"You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,\"\" said City Council Member Charles Barron. Daniel Mintz of MoveOn.Org said he was planning to deliver to Bloomberg more than 350,000 petitions and signatures he received Thursday from supporters around the nation. \"\"The mayor would do a lot better cleaning up Wall Street than cleaning up the plaza,\"\" he said. \"\"The park is clean,\"\" said Letitia James, a councilwoman from Brooklyn. \"\"The issue of cleanliness is a ruse, a disguise and nothing more than an excuse to end OWS.\"\" Some protesters could be seen sweeping up debris. Others said they have used donated funds to clean the park. A number of unions have pledged to support demonstrations cropping up in cities nationwide. Maida Rosenstein, president of UAW local 2110, said members of her chapter planned to gather at the park at 7 a.m., when the cleaning is scheduled to begin. \"\"If the mayor thinks he\\'s going to evict these protesters and end these protests, he needs to know that New Yorkers are watching,\"\" Rosenstein said. \"\"The unions are going to be there tomorrow and are also watching.\"\" Bloomberg met Wednesday with protesters and told them that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about \"\"unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park.\"\" \"\"The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,\"\" Deputy Mayor for Operations Cas Holloway said in a written statement. But the situation in the park is \"\"not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city,\"\" he said. The cleaning is to be done in stages, and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners, Brookfield Properties, the statement said. \"\"The park has not been cleaned in four weeks, a process that is normally undertaken every night,\"\" Brookfield said Thursday in a statement. \"\"Our goal is to keep the park clean, safe, and accessible to all.\"\" A walk in the park Thursday night found it in orderly shape. The only distinctive smell was an occasional waft of marijuana smoke. Loads of cardboard boxes holding clothes and other personal belongings were neatly tied up in one area; garbage bags were piled in garbage-collection areas; a number of people were cleaning up. Authorities have distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining a list of rules for protesters after the scheduled cleanup. The rules prohibit camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; using bicycles, skateboards or skates; and storing personal property that interferes with park use. Zuccotti Park was built for the general public, but the weeks-long protest has raised concerns among area business owners and residents about sanitation. The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. For almost a month, demonstrations have addressed such issues as police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Organizers have taken inspiration from this year\\'s Arab Spring protests that swept through North Africa and the Middle East. Crowds have taken up residence in the park in New York\\'s financial district, and organizers have called for 20,000 people to flood the area for a \"\"few months.\"\" CNN\\'s Susan Candiotti, Anna Gonzalez and Vivienne Foley contributed to this report.\",\"\"\"It\\'s not an occupation if you can\\'t occupy the park,\"\" spokesman says .\\nA UAW official says the union plans to join protesters Friday morning .\\nCleaning of Zuccotti Park is scheduled to begin 7 a.m. EDT Friday .\\nBrookfield Properties issues a list of rules for Zuccotti Park .\"\\n00b9bf421e847b9b77436076ccc7297bc9c9ed0d,\"Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the popular schoolboy and recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting.

But on Tuesday he posted his feelings of despondency, apparently over a romantic split, on Twitter. \\'It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I\\'m sweating it off...

All of the victims of the shooting were under 18, and three of the wounded were in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, said Joanne Roberts, chief of medicine at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The fourth wounded victim suffered less serious injuries. Describing the deadly attack, Jordan Luton told CNN: \\'He came up from behind and had a gun in his hand and he fired about eight bullets ... They were his friends so it wasn\\'t just random. \\'Then he turned and looked at me and my girlfriend ... and kind of gave us a smirk and turned around and then shot more bullets outside.\\' Other witnesses said he had a blank face when he walked into the room full of hundreds of students.

However, he said, Tongans had \"\"mixed feelings here in the community\"\" about the king. \"\"He lived a bachelor life, always a single man, and he traveled a lot around the world and spent money. He brought us in some ways forward into the 21st century, but some people have different -- not as good -- views on him.\"\" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her condolences in a statement Monday, crediting George V with guiding \"\"his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.\"\" Tonga, with a population of 106,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific.

In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs.

In an interview with\\xa0Newsday, Cromartie tells reporter Bob Glauber that his days of reckless spending have come to an end and that he is \\'all about saving money.\\' \\'I was out of control,\\' Cromartie said. \\'I remember [former Chargers teammate] Quentin Jammer used to tell me to slow down, but I couldn\\'t do it.

For example, at one point, Cromartie had \\'nine cars, two expensive homes, piles of jewelry, [gave] extravagant gifts and cash -- lots of cash -- to friends and family members who would simply ask, and shopping sprees that ran into the tens of thousands of dollars. Cromartie spent so much on so many things and so many people he can\\'t even remember where it all went.\\' Of the cars - which included two Dodge Chargers, two BMWs, two Cadilacs and a 1965 Caprice - Cromartie says he spent upwards of $100,000 just to fix them up. Cromartie - who is the middle of a four-year, $32 million contract with the Jets - has now recruited the help of a financial adviser, who credits the transformation to showing the 29-year-old athlete what it\\'s like to have a \\'settled\\' home life.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta will continue his work as a surgeon and for CNN. \"\"This is more about my family and my surgical career,\"\" Gupta told CNN\\'s \"\"Larry King Live.\"\" The neurosurgeon said he would likely have had to give up practicing had he taken the job as the nation\\'s top doctor. In addition, the 39-year-old and his wife are expecting their third daughter any time, and the government job would have meant long periods away from his family, he said. \"\"I think, for me, it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else,\"\" he said. \"\"I just didn\\'t feel I should do that now.\"\"  Watch Gupta explain his reasoning » . Gupta said he had not been formally nominated for the job, though he had spoken with senior members of the Obama administration, who made it clear he was their choice, he said. \"\"I think there was a real melding there,\"\" he said, adding that he felt flattered to have been considered. Earlier Thursday, an administration official said Gupta \"\"was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general. He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family. We know he will continue to serve and educate the public through his work with media and in the medical arena.\"\" Sources said in January that Gupta had met then-President-elect Obama in Chicago, Illinois, in November to discuss the post. At the time, Gupta declined to comment. The transition team was impressed with the combination of Gupta\\'s government experience, as a White House fellow in 1997 and a special adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, along with his medical career as a neurosurgeon and his communication skills, the transition sources said. Gupta is a member of the staff and faculty of the Department of Neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He regularly performs surgery at Emory University Hospital and at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he serves as associate chief of neurosurgery. Gupta joined CNN in 2001. As chief medical correspondent for the health and medical unit, he is a lead reporter on breaking medical news, provides regular health and medical updates for \"\"American Morning,\"\" anchors the half-hour weekend medical affairs program \"\"House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\"\" and reports for CNN documentaries. Based in Atlanta, Gupta also contributes health stories to CNN.com, co-hosts \"\"Accent Health\"\" for Turner Private Networks, provides medical segments for the syndicated version of \"\"ER\"\" on TNT and writes a column for Time magazine. He also anchors the global health program \"\"Vital Signs\"\" for CNN International and is featured in a weekly podcast on health issues called \"\"Paging Dr. Gupta.\"\" Just after joining CNN, Gupta became part of the team covering the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Later that year, he led breaking news reporting on a series of anthrax attacks. In 2003, Gupta reported from Iraq and Kuwait as an embedded correspondent with the U.S. Navy\\'s medical unit -- and worked alongside them, performing brain surgery five times. In addition, Gupta reported from Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the tsunami that swept the region in December 2004. He also helped cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and his medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical Center.\",\"\"\"This is more about my family and my surgical career,\"\" Gupta says .\\nSanjay Gupta is neurosurgeon, CNN\\'s chief medical correspondent .\\nGupta mentioned as possible surgeon general in Obama administration .\\nWhite House: \"\"We know he will continue to serve and educate the public\"\"\"\\n00bad06b94b77274e6f7e33e2a84e473f938cdac,\"Billie Jean King understands that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and that is how she is taking the advent of the International Premier Tennis League in Asia. The American legend was not just an inspirational driving force behind the growth of women\\'s tennis, but also the playing of the sport in the team format, having first founded the concept with her own league in the mid seventies. On Sunday night she was bringing her Mylan World Team Tennis event to London\\'s Royal Albert Hall, at a time when players joining up under the banner of a group outfit is suddenly all the rage. VIDEO Scroll down to see Billie Jean King speak about the Elton John Aids Foundation . BIllie Jean King and Tim Henman share a joke before the Mylan WTT Smash Hits event . King says she is flattered by the International Premier Tennis League copying her competition\\'s format . Her opposing captain in the charity event was Sir Elton John, who actually penned his classic Philadelphia Freedom song in 1975 as a favour to her, providing a theme tune for one of her professional tennis teams. King has looked at the four-team league currently going in Asia, and might be excused for envying the nouveaux riches of the format, given the eyewatering sums they are paying the players taking part. Roger Federer is reliably said to be collecting at least £2.5 million for his two appearances in India while Andy Murray\\'s fee for representing the Manila Mavericks in three matches is believed to be around £1m. Even the veterans taking part, such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, are reckoned to be pocketing well in excess of £500,000. Jamie Murray, Kim Clisters, Henman and Sabine Lisicki pose with King (centre) on Sunday . Sir Elton John (left) and John McEnroe (right) are involved in the event which takes place at the Albert Hall . Before the London event - featuring the likes of John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis – King spoke of her delight that her longstanding concept appears to be proliferating. It does not trouble her that her own version in America, which takes place after Wimbledon, cannot afford to attract the world\\'s top players in the way that the IPTL has done. \\'I\\'m thrilled, it\\'s a form of flattery,\\' she said. \\'We are celebrating our fortieth year next summer. This is fantastic. It\\'s really important to support tennis, whatever the level. The IPTL is taking professional tennis to new cities with great players. \\'I have always been in favour of the team format, always thought that children signing up to tennis should be in a team, they like to be with their friends. Team sports are the biggest in the world, that was my background originally and that of my brother, who played Major League Baseball.\\' In a sport where players are often resistant to any form of innovation, those participating in Asia and the Middle East have clearly been enjoying themselves and embracing the concept (as they ought to with its rewards). Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis will be among the stars of the game involved in King\\'s tournament . It is a lively product and television-friendly, fitting in to modern tastes, with players showing their personality. It is certainly hooking people in a way that is making the worthy week-in, week-out event the WTA and ATP Tours look very samey by comparison. What nobody in the game is quite sure is how the IPTL is making its sums add up, and how it will go forward after what looks already to have been a successful first year purely in terms of the product. But then in light of the deep pockets of some of the franchise owners they might not have to balance the books in the same way that more regular events do. McEnroe is also a supporter of the team concept: \\'You\\'ve got to remember that in the seventies team tennis was packing out stadiums, with players like Jimmy (Connors) and Bjorn (Borg) taking part,\\' he said on Sunday afternoon. McEnroe, Hingis, Sir Elton and Roddick pose with  Heather Watson at the pre-tournament press conference . \\'I think the key is this having its own time slot. Maybe the game changer part of this is that the schedule is a bit less year-round than it was. It\\'s got a bit more chance of being a success.\\' The least that the IPTL is going to do is fuel the current debate in tennis, traditionally resistant to change, about how it needs to broaden its appeal to cater more for modern demands. Sir Elton, who for twenty years has captained his team in charity matches against that of King, is also a keen advocate of the team format despite his enthusiasm for the game\\'s traditions. His sporting loves are football and tennis and, as he pointed out, he goes back a long way with both. He joked \\'I\\'m so old I can even remember (Jaroslav) Drobny beating (Ken) Rosewall at Wimbledon in 1954.\\'\",\"Billie Jean King has long been a promoter of team events .\\nMylan World Team Tennis taking place in London .\\nInternational Premier Tennis League proving a success in Asia .\"\\n00bb48094f8aed9b117bea36ef649b95b2bd823f,\"The man stabbed to death with a stiletto heel over the weekend has been identified as a professor at the University of Houston, authorities announced today.

When police got to the 18th floor condo, Trujillo opened the door and let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a hallway between the entryway and the kitchen.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Defence minister Anna Soubry said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces . The army was today ordered to end the booze-fuelled culture of ‘drinking to the point of oblivion’. Defence minister Anna Soubry said binge-drinking in the forces could not be justified as just a form of ‘comraderie’ or ‘letting down of the hair’. She was challenged by a committee of MPs about cheap alcohol on offer to troops, where a triple gin and tonic can cost as little as £1. The forces have long had a drinking culture, with officers viewing it as part of the bonding process between recruits and a way to relive stress from serving on the frontline. But Ms Soubry, a former health minister, said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces, and called for less binge-drinking by serving personnel. It follows high profile cases of debauchery, inappropriate behaviour and allegations of sexual assault fuelled by alcohol. Last week Army recruit Gavin Hope, 22, was fined £300 by the RSPCA for swallowing his pet goldfish as part of the NekNomination drinking game. He filmed himself drinking a pint glass of beer, spirits, a raw egg and some fish food, before downing a glass of water containing the unfortunate fish. The video was uploaded to his Facebook page along with the comment: ‘Not a proper man unless you drink fish.’ Today Ms Soubry insisted was not a ‘killjoy’ and recognised from her time as a barrister that people with stressful jobs needed to let their hair down. But she said the ‘vast amounts’ consumed by the armed forces were unacceptable and must be scaled back. ‘I am not convinced that we couldn\\'t do more about the culture of drinking in our armed forces,’ she said during a hearing of the defence select committee. ‘I\\'m not some killjoy. But sometimes there has been an attitude in the past that it was acceptable, as part of that de-stressing process, to all go out and consume vast amounts of alcohol as part of that camaraderie and that letting down of the hair. ‘There is nothing wrong with some of that, but the levels of drinking to the point of oblivion and all the rest of it is a culture which I don\\'t welcome in any workforce. ‘The incidence of binge drinking, the quantities of alcohol, across society are beginning to diminish. I would hope that would be the same in the armed forces.’ Swallowed: Gavin Hope and the goldfish Neknomination which lead to him to being brought before Gateshead magistrates court . Ms Soubry suggested that her determination to act had been strengthened by the death of a serving member of the armed forces. ‘I read the coroner\\'s report recently into a very sad suicide case of a serving person. There were many things in that report that concerned me. ‘One of them, quite clearly, the culture of heavy drinking,’ she said. A guide for senior commander on how to deal with alcohol is to be overhauled in the light of research into alcohol abuse in the armed forces which is due to be published soon. But she acknowledged that a cultural shift could not be encouraged purely by rules and regulations. ‘You can\\'t just put out edicts to change a culture,’ she said. ‘You can have all the most wonderful guides and manuals in the world but what\\'s most important is the implementation of them and that is something that I am looking at, I can assure you of that.’ Labour MP Madeleine Moon said ending the ‘high level of subsidy’ enjoyed at military bars would contribute to curbing consumption. She said she got the ‘fright of my life’ when she was charged only GBP1 for a triple gin and tonic while visiting forces in the Falkland Islands two years ago. ‘One thing that could be done about alcohol problems in the armed forces is tackling the high level of subsidy in bars in military units - perhaps so they were the same price you would pay in town.’\",\"Anna Soubry calls for an end to binge-drinking in the armed forces .\\nWarns \\'vast amounts\\' drunk by troops cannot be dismissed as \\'comraderie\\'\\nGuide for commanding officers to be overhauled to tackle booze culture .\"\\n00bcc69870cdffe5e108a7be95754c3476bf9082,\"Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- Skydiver Felix Baumgartner is aiming to pull off a record-breaking free-fall jump from the edge of space Tuesday, wearing nothing but a space suit, a helmet and a parachute. His goal is not only to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet, more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier, without the aid of anything besides the space suit. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. \"\"I\\'m not nuts,\"\" Baumgartner said when CNN first interviewed him about the project in 2010. \"\"You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I\\'m a very competitive person. I like the challenge.\"\" \\'Human helicopter\\' breaks record for world\\'s longest flight . But on a more serious note, he added, \"\"Of course I\\'m afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level. You know, I\\'m living a good life. I think the most important thing I\\'m doing is to come back alive.\"\" After years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor Red Bull, the jump is scheduled for Tuesday morning at dawn. Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent, in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon. Then he will climb out of his capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched \"\"delta\"\" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, before deploying a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth. The attempt has serious risks. He and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous \"\"horizontal spin.\"\" And at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit. And if he loses consciousness during the five-minute plunge, he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically. Another unknown: the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier. While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe that there will be little effect on Baumgartner, because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air, shock waves are barely transmitted. Baumgartner is an Austrian helicopter pilot and former soldier who has BASE jumped from landmarks like the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. He has been preparing for five years -- both physically and mentally. \"\"You have to remember all the procedures,\"\" he said in an interview during testing for the jump. \"\"You know you\\'re in a really hostile environment. And you cannot think about anything else. You have to be focused. Otherwise, you\\'re gonna die.\"\" The balloon, over 500 feet tall at launch, is light and translucent. The material is only .0008 of an inch thick, and it will change shape and size as it rises. The pressurized helmet and suit, which restrict Baumgartner\\'s mobility and weigh 100 pounds, have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt. Baumgartner was not doing interviews on the eve of the jump, but his performance coach Andy Walshe on Sunday described him as mentally well-prepared. \"\"He knows that he\\'s rehearsed it and knows what to do,\"\" he said. \"\"We want him in the right state of mind. We ask him to reflect on what he\\'s done, what he\\'s been through and what he\\'s achieving for himself personally, so he can relax and focus.\"\" The record is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission. On this attempt, 52 years later, Kittinger is a consultant and mentor. He has also been giving Baumgartner advice on what to expect. For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: \"\"There\\'s no way you can tell how fast you\\'re going, because there\\'s no visual cues.\"\" But Kittinger rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that Baumgartner is poised to beat his record. \"\"Oh no. I\\'m delighted,\"\" he told CNN recently. \"\"He\\'s advancing science, and he\\'ll do a great job.\"\"\",\"Felix Baumgartner will have only a space suit, helmet and parachute for 120,000-foot jump .\\nRecord of 102,800 feet was set in 1960 and is held by current mission\\'s consultant and mentor .\\nBaumgartner also hopes to be first person to break the sound barrier without a vehicle\\'s aid .\\nBesides speed, risks include low temperatures, thin atmosphere, possible loss of consciousness .\"\\n00be40289d0aea65afd2da6431db8a9fc8efc9c0,\"New York (CNN) -- In the spirit of spring rebirth, the Occupy movement is ramping up activities as warm weather blankets the country. But while the season is typified by a reawakening of life outdoors, demonstrators are using sleep to get their points across. They call it \"\"sleepful protest.\"\" The sleeping bags started appearing on the corner of Wall and Broad streets across from the New York Stock Exchange on April 9. A civil rights attorney sympathetic to the Occupy movement provided the legal justification for the move in the form of a court ruling from 2000. A federal district court judge said people can sleep on sidewalks as a form of political expression as long as they take up no more than half of the sidewalk and don\\'t block any doors. Occupy organizers declared a month ago that the movement would be planning a comeback in the spring and summer. Some city and state governments, armed with new ordinances aimed at the Occupy movements, are ready to prevent demonstrators from re-establishing encampments. For the past few nights, dozens of Occupy Wall Street protesters have slept on a patch of concrete a stone\\'s throw away from the traders and stock brokers who are the targets of their message. \"\"The goal here is to not violate the law and not give the police a reason to move the group,\"\" said Ted Schulman, who has taken part in Occupy demonstrations for several months. Every morning, they talk about income inequality and the role of big money in politics as commuters pass by on their way to jobs in the Financial District. Most people who work in the area seem indifferent. \"\"They just don\\'t understand how things work,\"\" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial. \"\"They have fantasy ideas. But, they\\'re entitled to their opinions.\"\" While police have occasionally forced the protesters to move so the sidewalk could be cleaned, and a few have been arrested, Occupy protester Lauren DiGioia is not deterred. \"\"We\\'re not afraid anymore. I mean, we\\'ve been through so much. All of us have been to jail,\"\" said DiGioia, a 27-year-old with hair dyed neon blue. \"\"We know we\\'re doing the right thing.\"\" What are Occupiers really fighting for? So-called sleepful protests have popped up elsewhere in the country with varying degrees of success. In Washington, police have been less accommodating, while in Los Angeles, protesters have taken to sleeping outside Bank of America branches, a frequent target of the Occupy movement. Similar sidewalk sleep-ins are taking place in Boston and Atlanta. The protesters on Wall Street don\\'t expect their sleep-in to grow into an encampment like the one that became home to hundreds of people at nearby Zuccotti Park. \"\"I view this as the pre-campaign. I certainly doubt that this will still be here May 1st when the big rallies start,\"\" Schulman said. \"\"My guess is by that point, they\\'ll have taken control of this space again.\"\" Occupy organizers are calling for large-scale demonstrations across the country on May 1 in conjunction with the labor movement\\'s International Workers Day.\",\"The Occupy Wall Street movement is ramping up its activities .\\nIn New York, protesters have moved to a sidewalk near the Stock Exchange .\\nProtesters plan for May 1 to be their first large-scale demonstration of the year .\"\\n00becc1bada9c481a7bfc7d4f972ce62db322e26,\"John Terry celebrated Chelsea\\'s 1-0 win at Sporting Lisbon by spending the day shopping in London with his wife Toni on Wednesday.

Diehard Orioles fan Mike Soukup was driving southbound on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Monday afternoon when he saw the accident and decided to pull over and help. Soukup, 55, started to help one man try to push the truck back on its wheels and after four or five others joined in they were able to get the truck upright. Baltimore Orioles fan Mike Soukup, right, got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was his sporting idols, Chris Davis . When Soukup turned to congratulate the achievement with the man next to him - the one who was the first on the scene - he recognized him as Orioles corner infielder Chris Davis. \\'I turned to high five the guy for a good job done getting this truck up, and I thought to myself, \"\"Man, that looks like Chris Davis,\"\"\\' Soukup told\\xa0The Baltimore Sun.

Lizzie Parry . A fit and healthy PE teacher lives under the dark cloud of her skin cancer returning, having suffered four bouts of the disease - despite never using a sunbed. Becky Giddins\\' melanoma relapsed three times since she was first diagnosed in April 2007. The 32-year-old suffered her fourth relapse in January, just a week after returning from her honeymoon. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed. Becky Giddins has survived four bouts of skin cancer, despite using sunbeds. Today the 32-year-old is raising money and awareness to help others fighting the disease. She was first diagnosed with melanoma when in April 2007 . Since being diagnosed Mrs Giddins, 32, has had a lumpectomy, half of her left lung and her lymph glands removed . Reliving her diagnosis, she said: \\'When they told me it was cancer I didn’t know how to react - I was on my own and it really didn’t sink in. \\'It only hit me when the doctors told me the mole was cancerous and it had be removed. \\'I was completely shocked, but relieved that they had removed it. \\'I have never been on a sunbed in my life - not even to build up a base tan before going on holiday. \\'As part of my job and coaching I’m outside a lot but, because I’m naturally fairly skinned, I’ve always worn sunscreen.\\' The skin cancer was first discovered after a weird mole on Mrs Giddins’ calf changed colour and became scabby. On visiting the doctor, a biopsy confirmed the growth was cancerous which meant the mole was removed along with a surrounding 2cm of skin. Following the operation, the teacher from Kidderminster in the West Midlands, lived cancer free for almost five years. As the cancer spread Mrs Giddins had to have a lumpectomy, a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed . In that time she met her future husband, Kevin. Over Christmas in 2011 - one week before her final CT scan to check whether she was in remission - Mrs Giddins found a lump in her groin. After a biopsy showed the melanoma had returned and spread to her lymph nodes, both were removed in February 2012 and a drain was fitted in her leg to remove lymph fluid. Mrs Giddins said: \\'The second time round I kept scaring myself looking things up on the internet and making myself quite upset. \\'Having the drain attached was horrible - I was permanently carrying this bag round me which was collection the fluid. \\'I refused to let it get me down though, so when me and the girls went out for my 30th birthday I bought an over the shoulder bag to cover it up.\\' Despite her cancer and the treatment she was undergoing Mrs Giddins continued to coach and play netball. After the drain was removed, she said she felt her freedom return. She was positive, hearing from surgeons that the area was now clear from cancer. Her latest treatment to have a lump on her breast and part of her lung removed took place six weeks before her wedding to Kevin, in August last year . Mrs Giddins returned to her job at a secondary school in Kidderminster, and she and her husband returned to their normal lives. On Christmas Day 2012 - three years after getting together - 32-year-old Mr Giddins proposed and the couple started planning their wedding for August 2013. But, as preparations intensified and the hunt for wedding dresses continued, the couple received the devastating news following a routine CT scan, that the cancer had spread to her lung. Six weeks before her big day, Mrs Giddins had a third of her left lung removed and a lumpectomy on her right breast, throwing the wedding into jeopardy. Melanoma is a rare cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of the disease is a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but is most often found on the back, legs, arms and face. In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and are more than one colour. They also tend to be larger than normal moles and can be itchy or bleed. Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is not known what causes the cancer, but it is thought exposure to UV light from natural or artifical souces may be partly responsible. There are around 13,000 new cases diagnosed in the uK every year. Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34 and is also responsible for most skin cancer deaths. More than 2,000 people a year die in the UK as a result of melanoma. Source: NHS Choices . She said: \\'After the operation I didn’t know whether I would be able to walk down the aisle, but the thought of marrying the love of my life really pulled me through. \\'When me and Kevin got together I didn’t class myself as a cancer patient as the mole had been gone for two years. \\'When it returned though, Kevin was a rock for me - along with my family - and I just wanted to marry him and celebrate our relationship no matter what.\\' Despite tying the knot in August 2013, their dream honeymoon had to be postponed as Becky could not fly for at least eight weeks post-surgery. Finally, on Christmas Day the pair jetted off to Las Vegas to celebrate their nuptials in style. There Mrs Giddins developed a pain in her side, and in spite of initially passing it off as a urine infection she felt a nagging that it was something more serious. But two days after returning home, doctors confirmed the melanoma had spread to her liver and urethra. She said: \\'I don’t like complaining but it just feels like me and Kevin can’t enjoy anything together. \\'I’m now on Dabrasenib and Trametinib to try and cure me, but if they don’t work there’s currently only one last set of drugs we can try. \\'I’m well aware I’m a bit of a ticking time bomb, but I just want to live a normal life, do a bit of travelling and keep playing netball.\\' The teacher is working to raise awareness of skin cancer, starting a fund, to which £2,500 has already been donated, for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Charity\\'s Skin Cancer Fund. Along with his brother Ian, cousin and five close friends, Mr Giddins will climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland in July.

RSPCA inspectors found a dog starved to death in a garden shed which had been jammed shut with a breeze block. The terrier was discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, a father-of-four, who later admitted three counts of animal cruelty. The 37-year-old, of Tipton, West Midlands, told inspectors the terrier called Molly had gone missing days before the discovery on March 16. Wollam, an unemployed foundry worker, told them he had no idea how she ended up starving to death in the barricaded shed. As he was sentenced at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday, he was told the case was one of the worst magistrates had seen. However, Wollam avoided prison because he is the sole carer of his four children after his ex-partner walked out on the family, the court heard. Banning him from keeping animals for life, the chair of the bench told the panel: \\'This is a very serious offence, one of the worst that has come before this court. \\'It is only because of your early guilty plea and domestic commitments you are not going to prison.\\' They gave him an 18-week suspended sentence and placed him under supervision for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work and pay £300 costs. Gaynor Sutton, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said an inspector visited Wollam\\'s address on March 16 after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours. They were told the dog had been bought from Wollam. When the inspector was let into his home by one of his children, an emaciated Bichon Frise dog was found to be around half its expected body weight. One of the dogs found at the Tipton home of Paul Wollam. The 37-year-old avoided prison after admitting three counts of animal cruelty . But the most grisly discovery was made when the breeze block was moved away from the shed door and the dead terrier was discovered. Mrs Sutton said: \\'The inspector saw the Shih Tzu in the garden and the dead terrier type dog in the shed. \\'There was a breeze block in front of the door. \\'The defendant arrived home and was shown the dead dog. He said he thought it had gone missing and that he had seen it a few days before. \\'The dog had matted hair and there was no food or water in the shed. An inspector visited Wollam\\'s address after finding an emaciated Shih Tzu with one of his neighbours . \\'The dog had been dead for some time and there were maggots in the coat. \\'A post mortem found an emaciated dog with hardly any body weight and the cause of death was assessed to be starvation. There were no broken bones.\\' In a statement, the vet who carried out the post mortem said: \\'The care of this dog was appalling, allowing a dog to die of starvation is despicable. A terrier type dog found dead in Wollam\\'s shed which was jammed shut with a breeze block . \\'Death would have been slow and prolonged. \\'There is a complete lack of care and compassion. This was death in the worst way imaginable.\\' Ravi Dev, defending, said: \\'He tells me he looked through the garden and in the streets but couldn\\'t locate the dog. \\'He did not realise it was in the shed.\\' Mr Dev went on to say Wollam, who had been made redundant from his foundry job, had suffered a period of depression after being left alone to care for his four children. \\'He was not coping properly,\\' he said. \\'It\\'s no excuse for what\\'s happened and he takes responsibility for that.\\'\",\"Terrier discovered in the garden of Paul Wollam, 37, of West Midlands .\\nThe father-of-four said Molly had gone missing days before she was found .\\nWollam said he had no idea how she ended up starving to death in shed .\\nThe dog had matted hair and there was no food or water in the shed .\\nWollam avoided prison because he is the sole carer of his four children .\"\\n00c478df3d3395655a87de8b5f638a69924c4158,\"By .

Victoria Woollaston . Last week’s emergency surveillance legislation may have sounded like something out of George Orwell’s novel 1984, but was cited as yet another real-life example of states trying to control their citizens. It’s been 65 years since Orwell described a fictional dystopian world of surveillance and manipulation by so-called Big Brother, and experts claim over the next decade this fiction is about to become fact. The Net Threats report from Pew Research Centre details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services all trying to control our behaviours. Scroll down for video . More than 1,400 experts were surveyed for The Net Threats report by the Pew Research Centre. The report details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services (stock image pictured) This could mean what we buy, read, watch and share will be restricted, and our surfing history stored for future use. More than 1,400 experts, including analysts, editors and professors, were canvassed for their opinion. The Pew Centre report discovered four major threats facing the web: . Actions by nation-states to maintain . security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and . segmentation of the internet. Trust . will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and . corporate surveillance - and will likely increase surveillance in the . future. Commercial . pressures and influences will affect the flow of information, and make . the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear . following debates about internet fast lanes. Efforts to fix the TMI (too much information) problem might over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing. According to their responses, they believe actions by nation-states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and segmentation of the internet. Trust will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and corporate surveillance - and this will likely increase surveillance in the future. And commercial pressures will affect the flow of information, and make the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear following debates over internet fast lanes. Paul Saffo, managing director at Discern Analytics and consulting associate professor at Stanford University, said that by 2025 \\'the pressures to balkanise the global internet will continue and create new uncertainties. \\'Governments will become more skilled at blocking access to unwelcome sites.’ Dave Burstein, editor of Fast Net News, added: ‘Governments worldwide are looking for more power over the net, especially within their own countries. ‘Britain, for example, has just determined that ISPs block sites the government considers ‘terrorist’ or otherwise dangerous. In 1984, Winston Smith is told to control the flow of opinion using the government\\'s language Newspeak (still from the 1984 Michael Radford film adaption is pictured). Experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea, and predict that, by 2025, it will become more common place, and spread across the west too . \\'This will grow. There will usually be ways to circumvent the obstruction, but most people won’t bother.’ The main criticism of such plans, and the main issue surrounding the data obtained, is its impact on privacy. Raymond Plzak, from The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, said: ‘The inconsistent protection of privacy, whether private information is voluntarily provided or not, as well as the inconsistent protection against exploitation will continue to be the bane of connected environment.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) has condemned the UK\\'s plans for an emergency surveillance bill, in what he described \\'as increased powers of intrusion\\' He continued that if local, regional, national and international private and public sector companies fail to join forces and accept a universal way of handling these privacy issues, sharing data and being connected will become more limited by 2025. This will also have an impact on preventing content being shared around the world. In 1984, character Winston Smith is told to edit reports and control the flow of opinion using the government\\'s language Newspeak, and experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea. And they predict that, by 2025, this will become more common place, and widespread across the West too. ‘The increased Balkanisation of the internet is a possible outcome of the [Edward] Snowden revelations, as people seek to develop systems that are less accessible by the NSA, GCHQ and so on,’ said Professor Kate Crawford, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Civic Media. ‘Meanwhile, the dominant content companies may seek ever more rigorous ways to prevent the flow of copyright content within and across borders.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden recently condemned the UK\\'s plans for an emergency surveillance bill, voicing concerns about the lack of public debate, fear-mongering and what he described \\'as increased powers of intrusion\\'. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. The controversial \\'fast lane\\' rules received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix for example, could pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies, such as Netflix (pictured), for faster delivery of their traffic to users. The Pew report said such commercialisation of the internet is the biggest challenge to its growth by 2025 . At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment.

Experts, including Glenn Edens, director of research in networking, security, and distributed systems at PARC said: ‘Network operators’ desire to monetise their assets to the detriment of progress represents the biggest potential problem.\\' A post-doctoral researcher, who was not named in the report, continued: ‘We are seeing an increase in walled gardens created by giants like Facebook and Apple. \\'Commercialisation of the internet, paradoxically, is the biggest challenge to the growth of the Internet.

They have bickered over the rich Pacific coast fishing waters for years, and Peru published a new map on Sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border. Chile\\'s government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in Peru, Cristian Barros, for consultations. \"\"We feel that this type of publication (map) and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the Peruvian government,\"\" spokesman Ricardo Lagos Weber said on Monday. \"\"Chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over Chilean territory,\"\" he said. Peruvian President Alan Garcia said in June his country would take Chile to the International Court at The Hague to resolve the case. Peru\\'s foreign minister, Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde, sought to downplay the row. \"\"It is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called (back to report),\"\" he said. \"\"The channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open, and the countries must work toward a positive agenda,\"\" Garcia Belaunde said. The sea border, set in the 1950s, starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean. But Peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles (37,900 sq km) of fishing waters. Its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the Pacific Ocean. Analysts say Peru will have its day in court and the Hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved, unless something happens to escalate the debate. \"\"The only thing that could happen, which would be very worrisome, would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty (in those waters) now that Peru officially claims them. That would be a shame,\"\" said Ricardo Israel, a political analyst in Chile. Chile defeated Peru in the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor. The two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky. The dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco, a grape liquor. Peru and Chile are the world\\'s top producers of fish meal, a cattle feed, and fishing is one of the engines of Peru\\'s economy. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

Battling out of his seat, Benjamin Levy\\'s ribs hurt so much he thought they were broken, but what struck him most about seconds after Asiana Flight 214 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of San Francisco airport was the silence. None of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken Boeing 777, no one from the cockpit announced anything - and now previously unseen pictures taken by Levy in the confused aftermath have been released by the Associated Press. Ignoring his pain, Levy, 39, rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed - losing its entire tail section. Escape: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214, many with their luggage, wait on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at San Francisco International Airport . \\'We were left on our own,\\' said Mr. Levy to the New York Times. \\'There was no message from the pilot, from the crew - there was no one.\\' Levy ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door, despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane. The wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach - making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway. Deciding not to exit the Boeing 777 through that exit, Levy, who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer, moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be. Survivor: Ben Levy speaks about being aboard Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6th, 2013, at San Francisco International Airport, during an interview at his office in San Francisco, on Tuesday, July 9th, 2013 . Ben Levy, (right), poses for photographs with his wife Sumi Lee Levy, as he wears a yellow ribbon put on by a firefighter on the tarmac for triage after Asiana Flight 214 crashed on Saturday . He moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat - forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt. \\'She couldn\\'t move,\\' said Levy to the New York Times. \\'There were two other guys. We couldn\\'t pick her up.\\' A firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered Levy and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane, which had now burst into flames. \\'People were pushing each other out. There was a lot of commotion. We got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out. I\\'m so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly.\\' Having landed at San Francisco many times before, Levy told NBC Bay Area that he knew the approach was wrong. Fiery Wreck: The flight crashed upon landing, and two of the 291 passengers aboard were killed . Collecting Their Thoughts: The passengers of Asiana Flight 214 hug each other after having survived the terrifying crash on Saturday . As has transpired, this was pilot Lee Kang-kooks first landing at San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft, despite being an experienced Boeing 747 pilot. \\'When he realized that, he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late,\\' Levy recalled in a phone interview with NBC Bay Area. \\'So we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again. And then we landed again pretty hard. \\'It felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely. He tried to correct, which probably helped. We would have hit the rocks.\\' As the plane\\'s belly skidded along the runway, Levy described the sheer terror inside. \\'It was surreal,\\' Levy said. \\'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.\\' Taken to San Francisco General Hospital, Levy was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family. \\'I am in pain, but not too bad compared to other people,\\' he said, adding on Twitter of his actions, \\'Just did what anyone in my position would have done.\\' Help: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the San Francisco International Airport . Despite Levy\\'s assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found, the bravery of cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye, the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised. Another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped. Lee herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety, despite suffering a broken tailbone that she didn\\'t know she had until she was finally treated at San Francisco hospital later. While it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of Asiana Flight 214 survived, it is \\'most likely\\' that one of the the two Chinese teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane. While a fire department spokeswoman said this on Monday, authorities are not saying if it was Ye Meng Yuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, who suffered the tragic accident. Head Count: The survivors of Asiana Flight 214 gather together on the tarmac of San Francisco International Airport after evacuating the Boeing 777 which crashed on landing on Saturday . \\'The incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles,\\' Mindy Talmadge, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg. \\'Most likely it was a fire vehicle, but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete.\\' And it has been revealed today that six of the 29 students on the flight who were headed to California as part of a summer camp are now stuck in limbo as their passports were destroyed in the crash. Indeed, the tour organizer, Adam Yu believes that the entire camp will be scrapped and the children will return to China in the next few days. \\'The students and parents are missing each other,\\' he said to the Daily Beast. \\'They need a few days to recover. They’re very emotional. It’s best for them to take a few days’ rest before sending them on an airplane again. It would be scary for them. \\'They were shocked.

The justices in an unsigned order Wednesday prevented any distribution of the live video stream outside the San Francisco, California, courthouse where the case is being heard, and any real-time or delayed posting on the Internet. In a trial that began Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco will decide whether the state\\'s Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage is constitutional. California voters approved the measure in November 2008, prompting an appeal by several homosexual couples. As part of a pilot program, the judge had agreed to allow video of the trial to be sent live to other rooms within the courthouse and to five other federal courthouses, and to be posted several hours later on the popular video site YouTube.com. Opponents of same-sex marriage had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, saying witness testimony could be affected if cameras were present. It is extremely rare for a federal trial to be televised to the broader public. The Supreme Court\\'s latest order allows distribution only to designated \"\"overflow\"\" rooms in the San Francisco courthouse, where people who want to view the trial but are unable to fit into the courtroom can watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television. A majority of Supreme Court justices concluded expanded broadcast should not permitted because, they wrote, \"\"It appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting.\"\" There has been much internal debate in federal courts around the country about the televised experiment, with several judges and administrators privately expressing concern that it could eventually lead to the entire judiciary being televised, including the Supreme Court. In dissent to the ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer and three liberal colleagues complained the public would be deprived of watching \"\"a nonjury civil case of great public interest to five other federal courthouses located in Seattle [Washington], Pasadena [California], Portland [Oregon], San Francisco [California], and Brooklyn [New York].\"\" He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens and Sonia Sotomayor. Breyer said the Supreme Court traditionally has stayed out of what he called another court\\'s administrative discretion on such matters, saying, \"\"I believe this court should adhere to its institutional competence, its historical practice, and its governing precedent -- all of which counsel against the issuance of this stay.\"\" The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (09A648).\",\"Lower court had OK\\'d posting videos of trial on Internet .\\nSupreme Court says no, but cameras can send trial to overflow rooms .\\nFour members of court dissent, led by Justice Stephen Breyer .\"\\n00cb16eb70b0124bb61e45b4df696a2d3598213f,\"(CNN) -- The family of a Rutgers University student who committed suicide after a sexual encounter was broadcast online has consented to the use of his name on a piece of anti-harassment legislation. The family of Tyler Clementi will allow Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, to use his name in the proposed federal legislation, to be known as the \"\"Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act,\"\" an attorney for the family said. Clementi\\'s body was recovered from the Hudson River in September, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge. The bridge spans the river between New York and New Jersey, which is home to Rutgers. Clementi jumped from the bridge after two other Rutgers students allegedly videotaped a sexual encounter between him and another man and streamed it online. The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid \"\"to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,\"\" Lautenberg said last month. The legislation also classifies cyber-bullying as a form of harassment. Lautenberg said that federal funding would be provided to colleges and universities to deal with harassment and bullying against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. \"\"The family appreciates the courtesy extended to them during the drafting of the bill, and hopes that the legislation, if enacted, will improve the well-being and safety of America\\'s college students,\"\" the family\\'s statement said. \"\"The Clementi family is humbled and gratified that the loss of their son, however painful for them, has inspired nationwide discussion and awareness of the need for a renewal of values of respect for human dignity and personal privacy, particularly for young people in this time of rapidly evolving technology.\"\" Dharun Ravi, 18, who was Clementi\\'s roommate, and Molly Wei, 18, have been charged with invasion of privacy.

A Coronation Street actress who is seen in the soap taking a cocktail of drugs to kill herself after being diagnosed with a terminal illness has said that assisted suicide should be legalised. Julie Hesmondhalgh, 43, plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from incurable pancreatic cancer and decides to end her life to stop the pain. Viewers will see her drink a cocktail of drugs before dying in the arms of her weeping husband Roy, who did not want her to give up her fight against the illness. Scroll down for video . Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, seen here playing Hayley Cropper alongside her husband, Roy, in Coronation Street, has spoken out in favour of legalising assisted suicide . Hayley, who has been in the programme since 1998, will use a cocktail of drugs to kill herself . The controversial episode will be aired on ITV next week after a series of high-profile so called right to die cases have gone before the courts. Locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson asked the courts for permission to end his own life with a doctor\\'s help. The 58-year-old was left paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak after having a major stroke. Unlike Julie Hesmondhalgh\\'s on-screen character, he was unable to commit suicide unassisted because of his disabilities. He died from ill health last year after the High Court ruled doctors could not help him kill himself - although his case will still go before the Supreme Court so they can rule on the issue. Mrs Hesmondhalgh – a member of the Humanist . Association, which supports assisted suicides – said she could not . imagine how anyone dealing with such an illness in either themselves or a . family member could be against the right to die. Emotional scenes: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, silently looks out of the flat window holding her husband Roy Cropper\\'s hand before she takes her own life in a controversial episode of Coronation Street to be aired next week . She said: ‘I would like to see it . legalised, very much so. But I have to put the caveat that it has to be . properly done; you have to make sure that people don’t go around killing . elderly people, say, just for the inheritance. ‘But I can’t imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson case and see his suffering and be against it,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It’s quite a simple thing for me – and I understand it isn’t for everybody – but we need to look at this issue seriously.\\' Official guidance was published which said people who help loved ones end their lives may escape prosecution even if they benefit financially from the death. Cancer battle: Viewers have seen Hayley Cropper (right) struggling to get out of bed as she battles with pancreatic cancer . The rules, set out by the Director for Public Prosecutions, make clear that anyone acting out of \\'compassion\\' is unlikely to face court action. Mrs Hesmondhalgh said there was an ‘almost holy atmosphere’ as she filmed her controversial last scene. The star, who joined Coronation Street in 1998 to play the soap’s first transsexual, won the hearts of viewers with her on-screen romance with cafe owner Roy. Away from the screen, she is married to writer and actor Ian Kershaw, taking time off in 2001 to give birth to her daughter Martha Mo. She has now decided to leave for good to concentrate on theatre roles. Right to die: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, is seen ending her own life in the controversial episode of Coronation Street which is due to air next week . The star\\'s character, who is suffering from incurable cancer, will kill herself in Monday\\'s episode . She told Radio Times that the scenes were not ‘beautiful’ and were ‘necessarily agonising, because of her steely determination to end her own life’. But she added that the storyline was ‘timely and appropriate’ and that ‘there are no easy answers’. ‘This is a conversation that needs to be had,’ she said. The . actress also said she had no problem being written out in such dramatic . fashion. ‘It would have been more convenient for me as an actor if I . could have come back later on if work wasn’t working out for me, but it . would have been a complete betrayal of everything that we’ve done . because they [Hayley and Roy] are the most steadfast and loyal and . loving couple... they just would not have separated for any other reason . apart from death.’ Keiran . Roberts, Coronation Street’s executive producer, said: ‘We’re not an . issue-based show but sometimes a story will highlight an issue and this . is such a case. ‘Pancreatic cancer is an illness . that people may not know a lot about and the right-to-die issue will . spark a debate, I’m sure, and that’s right and proper.’ The . storyline will reflect the split in opinion in the right-to-die debate . with Roy and Hayley’s friend Fiz Stape struggling to deal with Hayley’s . decision. The actress said: \\'I can\\'t imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson (right) case [the paralysed stroke victim who lost a case in 2012 to end his life by assisted suicide] and see his  suffering and be against it\\' Coronation Street producer Stuart Blackburn said: ‘This is a very sensitive issue and we will be exploring the effects of her decision on husband Roy who has a huge emotional and moral dilemma over her choice to die this way. ‘Not everyone will feel Hayley’s decision is the right one and we fully respect this. ‘For that reason we will be exploring both sides of the debate on screen.’ The Samaritans have warned that the storyline could create copycat suicides among vulnerable viewers. The on-screen controversy comes as a YouGov survey found almost three quarters of those questioned supported a change to existing laws regarding assisted suicide.\",\"Julie Hesmondhalgh plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from cancer .\\nShe ends her own life in the soap despite her husband\\'s objections .\\nThe actress, 43, said she is in favour of allowing assisted suicides .\\nHayley Cropper\\'s final moments will be screened across two episodes next Monday .\"\\n00cdede32ff010099a4e8c8288d1f494458cb941,\"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman failed to identify himself twice during a confrontation with Trayvon Martin and missed opportunities to defuse the situation that led to the death of the teen, a detective says in a newly released report. Zimmerman, who served as a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of Martin, 17, in Sanford, Florida. The report is part of information Florida prosecutors released Tuesday. It includes a previously undisclosed portion of a video of Zimmerman showing injuries he said he suffered in the altercation with Martin. Zimmerman, 28, told police he shot the teenager in self-defense and has pleaded not guilty. But Martin\\'s family and civil rights activists have said Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, racially profiled Martin and ignored a 911 dispatcher\\'s advice not to follow him. Among the documents released was a report from an officer who conducted computerized voice stress analysis tests on Zimmerman. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . \"\"Mr. Zimmerman was subjected to two exams, and was found to be classified as No Deception Indicated,\"\" the report said. Also released Tuesday was an unredacted capias request, a request that someone be taken into custody, prepared by the lead police investigator in the case, Christopher Serino. \"\"Investigative findings show that (Zimmerman) had at least two opportunities to speak with (Martin) in order to defuse the circumstances surrounding their encounter,\"\" Serino wrote in the report. \"\"On at least two occasions (Zimmerman) failed to identify himself as a concerned resident or a neighborhood watch volunteer.\"\" The detective also said Zimmerman\\'s actions \"\"are inconsistent with those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject.\"\" In the same report, Serino wrote that Zimmerman\\'s injuries were \"\"marginally consistent with a life-threatening violent episode as described by him.\"\" Zimmerman\\'s defense attorney, Mark O\\'Mara, filed a motion Wednesday asking that his client be allowed to appear at a Friday bond hearing in \"\"civilian clothing instead of a prison uniform and without restraints.\"\" Video and photos of Zimmerman shackled and wearing jail garb could prejudice prospective jurors, O\\'Mara said. In response to the document release, O\\'Mara said Tuesday it will be up to a judge and jury to interpret what Serino\\'s report means to the case. \"\"I don\\'t want to get into a battle with investigator Serino\\'s report considering what he believed after it seems he made the decision that charges should be filed,\"\" he said. \"\"His suggestion that it\\'s marginally consistent, again, is up for review. Those people will have to look at it, whether it\\'d be Judge (Kenneth) Lester in a motion hearing where the jury will also make that determination, whether or not those injuries give rise to a reasonable belief in George\\'s mind that he was a victim of great bodily injury or potential death.\"\" Martin\\'s family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said he agrees with the detective\\'s assertion. \"\"The lead detective made the determination at least on two different occasions Zimmerman had opportunity to defuse the situation. When he got out the car, he could have at least said, \\'I\\'m a neighborhood watch volunteer\\' to defuse the situation and it\\'s likely Trayvon Martin would be living today,\"\" Crump said. George Zimmerman: Trayvon Martin threatened my life . Also released Tuesday was a previously undisclosed portion of a video re-enactment of the incident that police taped a day after the shooting. In the video, Zimmerman, bandages on his head, talks about how his wife is treating his injuries. \"\"I have a broken nose. She says I could use stitches, but she\\'d rather not put them in -- as long as I didn\\'t mess with my head. My skin is already healing nicely,\"\" Zimmerman said. Also Tuesday, the Sanford Police Department announced that Serino had \"\"voluntarily\"\" asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer. Sanford Sgt. David Morgenstern said the change is not a demotion and he said he did not know why Serino requested the move. Crump said the move was clearly a demotion. \"\"The lead detective today got demoted and that\\'s one of those things we have to question. He told what he thought was the truth,\"\" Crump said. Zimmerman had been released on bond after his arrest. But he was ordered back to jail this month after a Florida judge revoked his bail, citing about $150,000 in donations in an account controlled by Zimmerman that he had not disclosed at the April 20 bond hearing. O\\'Mara is asking Lester, a Seminole County Circuit Court judge, to set a bond similar to the $150,000 bond initially granted Zimmerman, arguing that he poses no danger to the community, is not a flight risk, and \"\"cooperated fully\"\" with police before his arrest.

A Lothario lorry driver who wooed two women with marriage proposals then stole their life savings has been jailed for 20 months. Derek McMaster, 64, got engaged to both victims - one a kidney patient on dialysis - then plundered their bank accounts leaving them \\'permanently scarred\\'. These women only realised they were being two-timed as they plucked up courage to give evidence during his trial at Warrington Crown Court in Cheshire. Divorcee Jean Antrobus thought she had found the perfect gentleman, who behaved like an ‘angel’, buying her flowers every week and taking her away for romantic trips by the sea. But all the time he was stealing her money. Victim: Divorcee Jean Antrobus, pictured left, was one of the two women targeted by conman Derek McMaster, right, who was jailed for 20 months for his scam . McMaster of Falcon Hey, Liverpool, exploited his victims through lonely heart adverts in local newspapers and posed as a police officer, putting on a uniform and pretending to go to work. He changed his plea to guilty minutes before a jury was about to be sworn in. Recorder Andrew Long said: \\'This case involved the deliberate exploitation by you, of two vulnerable women. \\'It\\'s clear both women have been scarred, I suspect permanently. \\'You then gave self-pitying excuses for what you had done.\\' Prosecuting, Andrew Green described how McMaster first targeted kidney dialysis patient Margaret Dickinson. The 64-year-old has renal failure, Chron\\'s disease and chronic arthritis. The \\'perfect gentleman\\' moved in and became her carer, gaining trust to use her bank card and steal £3,150 between March and June last year. Elaborate: Warrington Crown Court (pictured) found that McMaster\\'s victims did not know they were being two-timed until they arrived to give evidence . McMaster then moved on to Runcorn mum-of-two Jean Antrobus, aged 64, who the court heard desperately wanted \\'a companion to stop feeling so alone\\'.. She \\'trusted him immediately\\', with McMaster claiming to be a semi-retired Merseyside Police officer, and even leaving the house in uniform. The fraudster asked her to marry him, then used her bank card to steal £5,275. He used the cash to pay for a ring, meals out and holidays to Rhyl. His deceit was uncovered when his victim attempted to pay for plastic surgery but found her card was over its limit. She needed counselling as a result and now feels \\'so guilty over my own stupidity\\'. The former shop worker said earlier this month: ‘I had been married for 38 years. I’d never answered a lonely . hearts advert in my\\xa0 life before, but I was feeling a bit fed up so I . decided to ring the number. ‘He was an angel at first, he bought me bouquets of flowers every week and took me away for weekends, a real gentleman. ‘He . said, “Let’s get married.

Trina Thompson has sued her alma mater, Monroe College of New York. Trina Thompson, 27, of the Bronx, graduated from New York\\'s Monroe College in April with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology. On July 24, she filed suit against the college in Bronx Supreme Court, alleging that Monroe\\'s \"\"Office of Career Advancement did not help me with a full-time job placement. I am also suing them because of the stress I have been going through.\"\" The college responded that it offers job-search support to all its students. In her complaint, Thompson says she seeks $70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three-month job search. As Thompson sees it, any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials, which include a 2.7 grade-point average and a solid attendance record. But Monroe\\'s career-services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment, she claims. \"\"They\\'re supposed to say, \\'I got this student, her attendance is good, her GPA is all right -- can you interview this person?\\' They\\'re not doing that,\"\" she said. Thompson said she has fulfilled her end of the job-search bargain, peppering companies listed on Monroe\\'s e-recruiting site with cover letters, résumés and phone calls. But no more than two employers have responded to her outreach, and those leads have borne no fruit. Her complaint adds, \"\"The office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their Monroe e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement. They have not tried hard enough to help me.\"\" She suggested that Monroe\\'s Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades. \"\"They favor more toward students that got a 4.0. They help them more out with the job placement,\"\" she said. iReport.com: \"\"Don\\'t sue your alma mater\"\" Monroe College released a statement saying that \"\"while it is clear that no college, especially in this economy, can guarantee employment, Monroe College remains committed to working with all its students, including Ms. Thompson, who graduated only three months ago, to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search.\"\" Thompson says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she cannot afford one. When she filed her complaint, she also filed a \"\"poor person order,\"\" which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit. Asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters, Thompson said yes. \"\"It doesn\\'t make any sense: They went to school for four years, and then they come out working at McDonald\\'s and Payless. That\\'s not what they planned.\"\" CNN\\'s Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.\",\"Monroe College graduate says career office didn\\'t help her with job placement .\\nShe seeks $70,000 for tuition and $2,000 to compensate for stress .', 'highlights': ['']}]\n"
