He'd already won it twice, as well as the U.S. and British Opens, but this was to be his \\\"Annus Mirabilis\\\" -- the year he cemented his reputation as a global sporting superstar.\\n\\n\\\"I was having some of my best times on the golf course,\\\" he told CNN, in trademark understated fashion, ahead of this week's Masters. \\\"I felt confident about myself and the way I was playing, and it worked out very well.\\\"\\n\\nAs the first major tournament of the golf year, the Masters is a springboard to some of the most magical moments in the sport's history.\\n\\nVictory at the prestigious and highly exclusive Augusta National Golf Club would be a career highlight for most players, but for a select few it is often just one jewel in an era-defining crown.\\n\\nPalmer had been determined to erase memories of the 1961 Masters, where he double-bogeyed the final hole to hand victory to South African rival Gary Player, the first international golfer to claim the coveted Green Jacket.\\n\\nThe following year Palmer led going into the final round, but needed two late birdies to go into a playoff with Dow Finsterwald and Player -- \\\"two of my very best friends in golf.\\\"\\n\\nHe started badly in the 18-hole contest on Monday but staged a remarkable late surge.\\n\\nFifty years on, Palmer's memories of his eventual triumph are still sharp. \\\"I had a pretty good back nine, that was the reason for my victory.\\\"\\n\\nFor \\\"pretty good\\\" read \\\"stunning\\\" -- Palmer conjured up birdies at 10, 12, 13, 14 and 16 for a 68 to better Player by three shots and don the famous Green Jacket for the third time -- he would again wear it in 1964.\\n\\nPalmer's caddy, Nathaniel \\\"Iron Man\\\" Avery, summed it up perfectly.\\n\\n\\\"He just jerks at his glove, tugs at his trouser belt and starts walking fast,\\\" he told reporters after the round. \\\"When Mr. Arnold does that, everybody better watch out. He's going to stampede anything in his way.\\\"\\n\\nThat year Palmer went on to claim his second British Open title at Royal Troon -- \\\"certainly one of my best Opens\\\" -- as he finished 12 under par on the seaside links to win by six from Kel Nagle.\\n\\nHis only setback came at the U.S. Open at Oakmont, in his home state of Pennsylvania, despite going into the tournament as a heavy favorite.\\n\\nAn eventual loss in an 18-hole play off to the 22-year-old Jack Nicklaus was \\\"very disappointing,\\\" said Palmer -- who three-putted 10 times in five days to undermine his fine play from tee to green.\\n\\nBut victories in six other PGA Tour events, as well as winning the Vardon Trophy (named after the famous English golfer Harry Vardon) for the U.S. circuit's low scoring average, rounded off an incredible year.\\n\\nGolf's greatest years\\n\\nBy dominating golf as he did that season, Palmer continued a trend started by Vardon in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as Bobby Jones and blazing a trail for the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\\n\\nVardon, known as \\\"Mr. Golf,\\\" set the ball rolling.\\n\\nBorn in the British isle of Jersey, he left an indelible mark on the game by inventing the Vardon Grip -- the overlapping of the small finger over the other when holding a club -- which is used by the majority of the top players in the world today.\\n\\nIn 1900 he crossed the Atlantic and became the first player to win both the U.S. Open and the British Open. Overall, he captured a record six majors in his homeland. In 1920, at the age of 50 and having suffered from tuberculosis, he still managed second place in the U.S. Open -- a true measure of his greatness.\\n\\nPaving the way for professionals\\n\\nThat decade, another golfing superstar emerged in the form of Walter Hagen, who like Palmer helped to popularize the sport with his attacking play and flamboyant lifestyle.\\n\\nThe American was the first golfer to win $1 million in his career, claiming 11 major titles plus five victories at the Western Open -- which in his era was one of golf's leading events.\\n\\nIn 1924, Hagen was at the peak of his powers and won the British Open as well as the U.S. PGA Championship (then a matchplay tournament). He also won three other PGA Tour events plus the Belgian Open.\\n\\nWhile Hagen helped the acceptance of professional players in a sport that had been mainly amateur, in 1930 another man became a worldwide name despite refusing to accept a cent for his many triumphs.\\n\\nFather of the Masters\\n\\nWhen the world's elite play at Augusta this week, they owe their participation to the foresight and vision of Bobby Jones, who co-designed the course with Alister MacKenzie and co-founded the Masters Tournament with Clifford Roberts.\\n\\nCompeting on an equal footing with Hagen and the top professionals, Jones had already won three U.S. Opens and two British Opens plus four U.S. Amateur crowns. But his feats of 1930 will surely remain unmatched.\\n\\nHe claimed his own grand slam of the two pro and two unpaid majors on both sides of the Atlantic before promptly retiring at the tender age of 28 to practice law at the Georgia bar.\\n\\nLord Byron\\n\\nThe Second World War brought an end to international competition, but that era saw the emergence of one of Palmer's heroes -- the great Byron Nelson.\\n\\n\\\"I watched him and admired him very much. He was one of the greatest players of all time,\\\" Palmer told CNN as he recalled the Texan's feats.\\n\\nNelson's greatest year was 1945, near the end of the war, when he set a record on the PGA Tour which will surely remain unbroken.\\n\\nThe Texan won 11 successive tournaments, beating the likes of Ben Hogan and Sam Snead. His 18 victories out of 35 starts included the PGA championship, and his scoring average of 68.33 stood until it was broken by Woods in 2000.\\n\\nNelson retired the following year aged 34 to become a rancher but was the host of a PGA event which bore his name until his death in 2006.\\n\\nHogan the hero\\n\\nAs the U.S. economy started booming in the post-war years, golf's profile was further boosted by the exploits of a player who bounced back from life-threatening adversity.\\n\\nBen Hogan took determination and will to win to new levels in 1953 when he won all three majors he was able to contest, and five of six tournaments overall. Badly injured in a car crash in 1949 which nearly claimed his life, Hogan had to limit his schedule to prevent strain on his body.\\n\\nH won the Masters by five shots and was six clear in the U.S. Open at Oakmont, while he conquered the field at Carnoustie in the British Open by four strokes to be the only man under par on the tough Scottish links.\\n\\nHogan was unable to play in the PGA Championships because it overlapped the British Open, but he would have chosen not to compete because he was unable to cope with the 36 holes per day expected of the players in the match play format.\\n\\nThe \\\"Golden Bear\\\"\\n\\nA decade after Palmer's great year, one of his arch-rivals bestrode the game like a giant.\\n\\nNicklaus, who had denied Palmer victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, was at the peak of his powers. \\\"It was easy to see that Jack would become a great player,\\\" said Palmer.\\n\\nNicklaus won two majors in 1972, the Masters and the U.S. Open, and was second to Lee Trevino at the British Open. Seven victories came on the PGA Tour and, like Palmer in '62, he won the money list and the Vardon Trophy.\\n\\nNicklaus would eventually set an all-time record of 18 majors, the final triumph coming at the Masters in 1986 with a famous final-round charge.\\n\\nChampions duel\\n\\nThe \\\"Golden Bear\\\" would next be challenged by Tom Watson, nine years his junior.\\n\\nWatson's win in their famous '\\\"duel in the sun'\\\"at Turnberry in 1977 will go down in golf history, but five years later his emergence was complete.\\n\\nWatson denied Nicklaus victory again at the 1982 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach with a miracle chip from the rough on the short 17th hole. The pair were tied for the lead with Watson looking certain to drop a shot when his effort hit the flag and went in for the most unlikely of birdies.\\n\\nIt helped seal a two-shot victory, which the American followed up by winning his fourth British Open title at Troon before being named the PGA Tour's Player of the Year for the fifth of six times overall.\\n\\nIce-cool Englishman\\n\\nThe balance of power in world golf shifted away from the United States in the 1990s, with England's Nick Faldo taking over as the No.1 as the decade started.\\n\\nWith an attention to detail and competitive edge modeled on Hogan, Faldo claimed the Masters for the second time in 1990 after a playoff with Raymond Floyd. At the home of golf St. Andrews, he dominated the British Open from the start to win by five shots with a record 18-under aggregate.\\n\\nFaldo also finished tied for third, one shot back, in the U.S. Open at Medinah and was named golfer of the year on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nTiger on the prowl\\n\\nHowever, golf had to wait another decade before the astonishing feats of a player who has become one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet, and certainly one of the richest.\\n\\nTiger Woods could manage only fifth place at the 2000 Masters at Augusta, but it was to prove just about his only disappointment in a record-breaking year.\\n\\nHis 15-stroke victory in the U.S Open at Pebble Beach was \\\"the greatest performance in golf history\\\" according Sports Illustrated magazine. The American broke Faldo's British Open record with an eight-shot win at St. Andrews and made it three majors for the year by beating Bob May in a playoff at the PGA Championship.\\n\\nWoods won nine of 20 PGA Tour events that year, with the lowest scoring average in history. He then won the 2001 Masters to hold all four of golf's major titles -- the first player to do so in the modern era.\\n\\nPalmer believes the 36-year-old, who won his invitational tournament at Bay Hill last month to end a PGA Tour title drought dating back to 2009, \\\"can return to his best\\\" in 2012.\\n\\nThe world of golf is waiting to see.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Washington (CNN) -- Facing low approval ratings and constant Republican criticism as his re-election campaign starts up, President Barack Obama challenged Congress on Thursday night to put the good of the nation over political benefit and pass a huge jobs plan he proposed.\\n\\nIn a speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama told the legislators to \\\"stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy\\\" by quickly approving the $447 billion package of measures so he can sign it into law.\\n\\n\\\"The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities. The question tonight is whether we'll meet ours,\\\" Obama said to applause. \\\"The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy. The question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.\\\"\\n\\nObama also told legislators that they should quickly pass his plan, called the American Jobs Act.\\n\\n\\\"There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation,\\\" the president said. \\\"Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight. And everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything.\\\"\\n\\nObama said he will ask Congress to increase the $1.5 trillion target in deficit reduction being pursued by a special joint congressional committee to cover the cost of the American Jobs Act. He said he will propose his own deficit-reduction plan on September 19 that would reform entitlement programs such as Medicare while changing the tax system to end loopholes, lower the corporate tax rate and increase taxes for the wealthy.\\n\\nIn essence, Obama resurrected his push for a so-called \\\"grand bargain\\\" -- a comprehensive deficit reduction package that includes all the drivers of government spending and deficits, including those traditionally favored and protected by both parties.\\n\\nRepublican reaction ranged from an expressed interest in trying to work out compromise to outright rejection and criticism of what was labeled a repeat of failed policies from the past.\\n\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, who backed out of talks with Obama on a major deficit reduction-deal deal earlier this year, said the proposals the president outlined \\\"merit consideration,\\\" and added that he hoped for serious consideration by the White House of Republican ideas.\\n\\n\\\"It's my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses, and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation,\\\" said Boehner, R-Ohio.\\n\\nConservative Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was much more critical.\\n\\n\\\"President Obama, perhaps not knowing what else to do, is simply calling for more of the same, as if giving us more of the failed policies of the last two-and-a-half years will somehow yield different results,\\\" Kyl said in a statement. \\\"I believe President Obama's new 'stimulus' will further delay economic recovery and continue to inflict harm on so many Americans.\\\"\\n\\nThe Senate's top Democrat, meanwhile, said Obama's proposal will present a \\\"litmus test\\\" for Republicans.\\n\\n\\\"I hope they (Republicans) will show the American people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating President Obama,\\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said in a statement. \\\"Experts from the ratings agencies to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have said that political gridlock is the main obstacle standing in the way of our economic growth. It is time to put jobs and the economy ahead of partisan politics.\\\"\\\\\\n\\nThat point resonated with veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who joked on CNN that the president's poll numbers were very bad, but \\\"have you seen Congress' numbers?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We seek approval, too,\\\" McCain said.\\n\\nAccording to Obama, the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is \\\"to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term unemployed,\\\" Obama said. \\\"It will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will be customers for their products and services. You should pass this jobs plan right away.\\\"\\n\\nHe also told Republicans he would take his case directly to the American people, and called on \\\"every American who agrees to lift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option,\\\" Obama said.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN that Obama will send Congress jobs plan legislation next week.\\n\\nObama's plan comes as unemployment remains lodged at 9.1% with no new jobs reported in August, raising fears of a possible return to recession. With 14 months to go until the presidential election, he wants the plan -- as well as the speech to Congress to present it -- to clearly illustrate to the American public the ideological differences between his policies and those of the Republican right.\\n\\nThe mood in the House chamber was jovial before the speech, with Vice President Joe Biden playfully hugging Speaker John Boehner when he arrived at the dais. Democratic legislators repeatedly applauded during the address.\\n\\nHouse Republican and White House sources told CNN that Obama called Boehner and McConnell on Thursday afternoon to preview the speech. Even so, a legislative struggle is certain. Republicans call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth, opposing what they label new stimulus spending.\\n\\nThe Democratic leader in the Republican-controlled House -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California -- asked the ranking Democrats on committees that will consider the legislation proposed by Obama to urge their Republican chairmen to \\\"schedule immediate hearings and legislative action\\\" on the measures.\\n\\nBoehner, meanwhile, invited 12 business leaders -- dubbed \\\"job creators\\\" in his statement -- who have been affected by regulations enacted by the administration to attend the speech.\\n\\nThese are \\\"people with real world experience on how the regulations coming out of this administration are impeding their ability to grow their business and create jobs,\\\" Boehner's statement said.\\n\\nAt least five Republicans -- two senators and three House members -- didn't plan to attend the speech, which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said was more of a political event than a policy statement.\\n\\n\\\"By all accounts, the president's so-called jobs plan is to try those very same policies again and then accuse anyone who doesn't support them this time around of being political and overly partisan, of not doing what's needed in this moment of crisis,\\\" McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Thursday morning. \\\"This isn't a jobs plan. It is a re-election plan.\\\"\\n\\nAnticipating such criticism, Obama said he was proposing needed and logical measures that traditionally receive broad support.\\n\\n\\\"This isn't political grandstanding. This isn't class warfare. This is simple math,\\\" he said. \\\"These are real choices that we have to make. And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close. And it's time for us to do what's right for our future.\\\"\\n\\nObama said his plan would increase the current payroll tax cut to put additional money in the pockets of Americans at a cost of $175 billion. The current cut, which has cost $112 billion so far, allows employees to pay 4.2% instead of 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security.\\n\\nObama's proposal included extended unemployment benefits, which were lengthened to the current 99-week maximum in 2009. Top Democrats argue that such money will immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending.\\n\\nIn addition, the plan proposes $60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges, including establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects.\\n\\nOther provisions in the president's proposal include money to refurbish schools and provide state aid for teachers and first responders, and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long-term unemployed and military veterans.\\n\\nLooking abroad, the president also renewed his push for congressional approval of stalled free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. The measures, despite the congressional roadblock, have relatively broad bipartisan support.\\n\\nThe president took aim at tea party conservatives who call for deep spending cuts to shrink government instead of the comprehensive approach he advocates.\\n\\n\\\"In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own -- that's not who we are,\\\" Obama said.\\n\\nHe repeatedly urged the legislators to \\\"pass this jobs bill,\\\" using a rhetorical flourish that regularly prompted cheers and applause form Democrats.\\n\\n\\\"No single individual built America on their own,\\\" Obama said. \\\"We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.\\\"\\n\\nCNN's Alan Silverleib, Charles Riley, Jessica Yellin, Brianna Keilar, Tom Cohen and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.\\n\\n\",\n          \"(CNN) -- \\\"Nostalgia\\\" and flimsy evidence led to guilty verdicts in the nation's oldest cold case ever solved, according to the man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and murdering a neighbor's child in 1957.\\n\\nIn his 80-page appeal, former police officer Jack Daniel McCullough says he deserves a new trial because his mother was allowed to accuse him from the grave -- while he was kept from proving that he was elsewhere when a 7-year-old girl was abducted and killed.\\n\\nThe appellate brief, filed Thursday by the Illinois state appellate defender, noted that nobody saw who grabbed Maria Ridulph from a street corner in Sycamore, Illinois, or witnessed how or where she was killed.\\n\\nNo forensic evidence ties McCullough -- or anyone else -- to a crime so shocking it captured the attention of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the appeal states.\\n\\nInstead, the court papers say, prosecutors built their case on unreliable evidence, including inmate witnesses whose motives were suspect and others whose memories were dulled by the passage of time:\\n\\n\\\"The evidence against Jack McCullough,\\\" the appeal contended, \\\"was so unreasonable, so improbable, and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder, kidnapping, and abduction of an infant.\\\"\\n\\nThat evidence included \\\"personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident; testimony from jailhouse informants; innocuous statements from the defendant; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant's mother while on morphine and Haldol just before her death.\\\"\\n\\nThe appeal cited many of the issues raised by legal experts who spoke with CNN for \\\"Taken: The coldest case ever solved,\\\" a five-part multimedia series published in August. The series was the basis for an hour-long documentary that aired on HLN.\\n\\nRead the appeal (PDF)\\n\\nMcCullough was convicted in September 2012 of kidnapping and murdering Maria Ridulph 55 years earlier. The brown-eyed second-grader vanished from the corner of Sycamore's Archie Place and Center Cross Street on the evening of December 3, 1957.\\n\\nHer body was found the following spring in a grove of trees off a busy state highway about 120 miles away. The crime, which shook the small farming community to its core, is believed to be the country's oldest cold case ever prosecuted.\\n\\nNow 74, McCullough is serving a life sentence at a state prison in Pontiac, Illinois.\\n\\nHe denied committing the crime in several letters to CNN and in a jailhouse interview last year. He also denied having anything to do with Maria's disappearance and death in a lengthy police interrogation in Seattle hours before his arrest. Prosecutors and investigators said his odd demeanor during questioning convinced them they had the right man.\\n\\nThe DeKalb County State's Attorney, which prosecuted McCullough, declined comment and referred calls to the Illinois state appellate prosecutor, which also declined to comment on a pending case. A court clerk said both sides should finish filing their briefs by late June and arguments could be scheduled by summer.\\n\\n\\\"I think the problem with Jack's trial is, it was all emotion-based,\\\" said Janey O'Connor, McCullough's stepdaughter and most outspoken defender. She said she hopes his lawyers can convince the appeals court to view the case with a more objective eye.\\n\\n\\\"To find a man guilty based on conflicting stories, unconstitutional rulings and emotion and not allow Jack the chance to present the evidence that cleared his name in 1957 goes against our constitutional rights,\\\" she said.\\n\\nTestimony lasted little more than a week at McCullough's trial, which was decided by a judge brought in from a neighboring county.\\n\\nFor the most part, the appeal focused on Judge James Hallock's pretrial rulings regarding what evidence to allow and what evidence to exclude.\\n\\nHallock used an exception to the hearsay rule to let McCullough's sisters testify about a deathbed statement by their mother but excluded as hearsay police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation. He also excluded a Sycamore police detective's investigation during the mid-1990s that concluded that another man, now deceased, committed the crime.\\n\\n\\\"In a court with murder charges at issue, the law demands more than nostalgia,\\\" state appellate defender Paul Glaser wrote. \\\"It demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\" Glaser did not represent McCullough at his trial; he was appointed by the state to handle his appeal.\\n\\nThe appeal noted that prosecutors \\\"took great effort to describe the gentle, small-town nature of Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957.\\\" It was a time and place where the abduction and murder of a child playing in the season's first snow \\\"was a shocking, defining and tragic event,\\\" the appeal said, but criminal responsibility for kidnapping, child abduction and murder \\\"needed to be proven to competent evidence.\\\"\\n\\nIn this case, the appeal stated, the evidence presented against McCullough \\\"woefully failed to rise to the level of proof necessary to sustain his conviction.\\\" The appeal criticized Hallock's rulings as a \\\"gross abuse of discretion\\\" that prevented McCullough from receiving a fair trial.\\n\\nHallock declined to comment on the case, citing Illinois' code of judicial conduct.\\n\\nMcCullough's appellate lawyers focused their attack on a hospital bed accusation by his sedated, dying mother that prompted Illinois State Police to reopen their investigation. The defense has long argued that it should never have been disclosed in court.\\n\\nMcCullough's sisters testified that their mother told them \\\"John did it\\\" or \\\"he did it\\\" but gave contradicting testimony on what she meant by \\\"it.\\\"\\n\\nEileen Tessier, who was in the end stages of cancer, was sedated, \\\"emotionally disturbed,\\\" sometimes \\\"basically comatose\\\" and at other times \\\"pleasantly confused,\\\" the testimony showed.\\n\\nProsecutors persuaded Hallock to allow the statement under a hearsay exception, arguing that Tessier could have faced obstruction of justice charges herself for covering up for her son all those years. But the appellate lawyers countered that criminal charges weren't a realistic possibility for a terminally ill woman.\\n\\n\\\"Instead the statement was an out-of-court accusation,\\\" the appeal stated, \\\"the admission of which should have been strictly forbidden.\\\"\\n\\nKathy Sigman Chapman was the prosecution's star witness and the last person to see Maria alive, besides the killer. Chapman, who was 8 at the time her friend vanished, was shown hundreds if not thousands of photographs as a child but didn't identify the stranger who called himself \\\"Johnny\\\" until 53 years after the crime.\\n\\nShe was in her 60s and living in a neighboring city when an Illinois State Police detective knocked on her door and showed her a group of photographs. She picked one she had not seen before -- a recropped prom photo showing 17-year-old John Tessier, as McCullough was then known -- and identified him as the young man who gave Maria a piggyback ride minutes before she vanished.\\n\\nShe also identified the photograph in court, but the appeal asserts that the appearance of the man in the photo differs from the description she gave in court of the man she saw on the street corner.\\n\\nThree jailhouse informants testified about conversations they said they had with McCullough while he was awaiting trial. They gave varying accounts of how he described killing her: with a wire, strangling her with his hands or dropping her on her head.\\n\\nThe informants and several police detectives from Seattle, where McCullough was initially questioned and arrested, also testified about odd statements he made about Maria Ridulph. They said he described her as \\\"lovely,\\\" with big brown eyes and \\\"like a little Barbie doll.\\\" While the appeal referred to those statements and vivid descriptions of a little girl he knew 50 years ago as \\\"innocuous,\\\" others have described them as unsettling, even \\\"creepy.\\\"\\n\\nGiven the circumstantial nature of the prosecution's case, the appeal asserted, the defense should have been able to expect some leeway. But, court papers say, the judge's pretrial rulings prevented McCullough from presenting his defense. He was unable to call a witness, former Sycamore police detective Patrick Solar, who concluded during the mid-1990s that another man committed the crime.\\n\\nAnd he was not permitted to present police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation that indicated he was questioned and cleared from the list of suspects because he had an alibi.\\n\\nThe reports indicated that McCullough spoke with military recruiters in Rockford, about 40 miles away, about the time Maria was taken from the street corner in Sycamore. They also seemed to verify his story that he made a collect call home, asking for a ride. Phone records at the time, long since lost, indicated that a collect call was placed from a pay phone in Rockford to the Tessier family home in Sycamore at 6:57 p.m. by someone giving his name as \\\"John Tassier.\\\" The call lasted two minutes.\\n\\nIllinois law does not allow police reports and other documents as a substitute for witness testimony at trials. But in this case, almost all of the FBI agents and police investigators had died, and McCullough's defense sought to introduce the reports as \\\"ancient documents\\\" or public records more than 20 years old. Hallock, the trial judge, rejected that argument.\\n\\n\\\"The judge's decisions to prohibit Jack McCullough from introducing FBI records prepared at the time of the offense, despite their status as ancient documents and public records and their probative value in establishing Mr. McCullough's alibi, and to prohibit Mr. McCullough from presenting testimony showing another man committed the offense, amounted to gross abuses of discretion denying Mr. McCullough his fundamental right to present a defense,\\\" the appeal stated.\\n\\nBy blocking the defense while allowing prosecutors to introduce \\\"irrelevant, but highly prejudicial evidence,\\\" the judge violated McCullough's right to a fair trial, the appeal stated, before delivering a final salvo: \\\"No rational trier of fact would have found the defendant guilty.\\\"\\n\\nPolice get break in missing girls' cold case from 1975\\n\\nArrest in 40-year-old murder case\\n\\nFour decades later, disappearance of 2 missing girls blamed on wreck\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He'd already won it twice, as well as the U.S. and British Opens, but this was to be his Annus Mirabilis -- the year he cemented his reputation as a global sporting superstar.I was having some of my best times on the golf course, he told CNN, in trademark understated fashion, ahead of this week's Masters. I felt confident about myself and the way I was playing, and it worked out very well.As the first major tournament of the golf year, the Masters is a springboard to some of the most magical moments in the sport's history.Victory at the prestigious and highly exclusive Augusta National Golf Club would be a career highlight for most players, but for a select few it is often just one jewel in an era-defining crown.Palmer had been determined to erase memories of the 1961 Masters, where he double-bogeyed the final hole to hand victory to South African rival Gary Player, the first international golfer to claim the coveted Green Jacket.The following year Palmer led going into the final round, but needed two late birdies to go into a playoff with Dow Finsterwald and Player -- two of my very best friends in golf.He started badly in the 18-hole contest on Monday but staged a remarkable late surge.Fifty years on, Palmer's memories of his eventual triumph are still sharp. I had a pretty good back nine, that was the reason for my victory.For pretty good read stunning -- Palmer conjured up birdies at 10, 12, 13, 14 and 16 for a 68 to better Player by three shots and don the famous Green Jacket for the third time -- he would again wear it in 1964.Palmer's caddy, Nathaniel Iron Man Avery, summed it up perfectly.He just jerks at his glove, tugs at his trouser belt and starts walking fast, he told reporters after the round. When Mr. Arnold does that, everybody better watch out. He's going to stampede anything in his way.That year Palmer went on to claim his second British Open title at Royal Troon -- certainly one of my best Opens -- as he finished 12 under par on the seaside links to win by six from Kel Nagle.His only setback came at the U.S. Open at Oakmont, in his home state of Pennsylvania, despite going into the tournament as a heavy favorite.An eventual loss in an 18-hole play off to the 22-year-old Jack Nicklaus was very disappointing, said Palmer -- who three-putted 10 times in five days to undermine his fine play from tee to green.But victories in six other PGA Tour events, as well as winning the Vardon Trophy (named after the famous English golfer Harry Vardon) for the U.S. circuit's low scoring average, rounded off an incredible year.Golf's greatest yearsBy dominating golf as he did that season, Palmer continued a trend started by Vardon in the first year of the 20th century -- following in the footsteps of golf legends such as Bobby Jones and blazing a trail for the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.Vardon, known as Mr. Golf, set the ball rolling.Born in the British isle of Jersey, he left an indelible mark on the game by inventing the Vardon Grip -- the overlapping of the small finger over the other when holding a club -- which is used by the majority of the top players in the world today.In 1900 he crossed the Atlantic and became the first player to win both the U.S. Open and the British Open. Overall, he captured a record six majors in his homeland. In 1920, at the age of 50 and having suffered from tuberculosis, he still managed second place in the U.S. Open -- a true measure of his greatness.Paving the way for professionalsThat decade, another golfing superstar emerged in the form of Walter Hagen, who like Palmer helped to popularize the sport with his attacking play and flamboyant lifestyle.The American was the first golfer to win $1 million in his career, claiming 11 major titles plus five victories at the Western Open -- which in his era was one of golf's leading events.In 1924, Hagen was at the peak of his powers and won the British Open as well as the U.S. PGA Championship (then a matchplay tournament). He also won three other PGA Tour events plus the Belgian Open.While Hagen helped the acceptance of professional players in a sport that had been mainly amateur, in 1930 another man became a worldwide name despite refusing to accept a cent for his many triumphs.Father of the MastersWhen the world's elite play at Augusta this week, they owe their participation to the foresight and vision of Bobby Jones, who co-designed the course with Alister MacKenzie and co-founded the Masters Tournament with Clifford Roberts.Competing on an equal footing with Hagen and the top professionals, Jones had already won three U.S. Opens and two British Opens plus four U.S. Amateur crowns. But his feats of 1930 will surely remain unmatched.He claimed his own grand slam of the two pro and two unpaid majors on both sides of the Atlantic before promptly retiring at the tender age of 28 to practice law at the Georgia bar.Lord ByronThe Second World War brought an end to international competition, but that era saw the emergence of one of Palmer's heroes -- the great Byron Nelson.I watched him and admired him very much. He was one of the greatest players of all time, Palmer told CNN as he recalled the Texan's feats.Nelson's greatest year was 1945, near the end of the war, when he set a record on the PGA Tour which will surely remain unbroken.The Texan won 11 successive tournaments, beating the likes of Ben Hogan and Sam Snead. His 18 victories out of 35 starts included the PGA championship, and his scoring average of 68.33 stood until it was broken by Woods in 2000.Nelson retired the following year aged 34 to become a rancher but was the host of a PGA event which bore his name until his death in 2006.Hogan the heroAs the U.S. economy started booming in the post-war years, golf's profile was further boosted by the exploits of a player who bounced back from life-threatening adversity.Ben Hogan took determination and will to win to new levels in 1953 when he won all three majors he was able to contest, and five of six tournaments overall. Badly injured in a car crash in 1949 which nearly claimed his life, Hogan had to limit his schedule to prevent strain on his body.H won the Masters by five shots and was six clear in the U.S. Open at Oakmont, while he conquered the field at Carnoustie in the British Open by four strokes to be the only man under par on the tough Scottish links.Hogan was unable to play in the PGA Championships because it overlapped the British Open, but he would have chosen not to compete because he was unable to cope with the 36 holes per day expected of the players in the match play format.The Golden BearA decade after Palmer's great year, one of his arch-rivals bestrode the game like a giant.Nicklaus, who had denied Palmer victory at the 1962 U.S. Open, was at the peak of his powers. It was easy to see that Jack would become a great player, said Palmer.Nicklaus won two majors in 1972, the Masters and the U.S. Open, and was second to Lee Trevino at the British Open. Seven victories came on the PGA Tour and, like Palmer in '62, he won the money list and the Vardon Trophy.Nicklaus would eventually set an all-time record of 18 majors, the final triumph coming at the Masters in 1986 with a famous final-round charge.Champions duelThe Golden Bear would next be challenged by Tom Watson, nine years his junior.Watson's win in their famous 'duel in the sun'at Turnberry in 1977 will go down in golf history, but five years later his emergence was complete.Watson denied Nicklaus victory again at the 1982 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach with a miracle chip from the rough on the short 17th hole. The pair were tied for the lead with Watson looking certain to drop a shot when his effort hit the flag and went in for the most unlikely of birdies.It helped seal a two-shot victory, which the American followed up by winning his fourth British Open title at Troon before being named the PGA Tour's Player of the Year for the fifth of six times overall.Ice-cool EnglishmanThe balance of power in world golf shifted away from the United States in the 1990s, with England's Nick Faldo taking over as the No.1 as the decade started.With an attention to detail and competitive edge modeled on Hogan, Faldo claimed the Masters for the second time in 1990 after a playoff with Raymond Floyd. At the home of golf St. Andrews, he dominated the British Open from the start to win by five shots with a record 18-under aggregate.Faldo also finished tied for third, one shot back, in the U.S. Open at Medinah and was named golfer of the year on both sides of the Atlantic.Tiger on the prowlHowever, golf had to wait another decade before the astonishing feats of a player who has become one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet, and certainly one of the richest.Tiger Woods could manage only fifth place at the 2000 Masters at Augusta, but it was to prove just about his only disappointment in a record-breaking year.His 15-stroke victory in the U.S Open at Pebble Beach was the greatest performance in golf history according Sports Illustrated magazine. The American broke Faldo's British Open record with an eight-shot win at St. Andrews and made it three majors for the year by beating Bob May in a playoff at the PGA Championship.Woods won nine of 20 PGA Tour events that year, with the lowest scoring average in history. He then won the 2001 Masters to hold all four of golf's major titles -- the first player to do so in the modern era.Palmer believes the 36-year-old, who won his invitational tournament at Bay Hill last month to end a PGA Tour title drought dating back to 2009, can return to his best in 2012.The world of golf is waiting to see.\",\n          \"Washington (CNN) -- Facing low approval ratings and constant Republican criticism as his re-election campaign starts up, President Barack Obama challenged Congress on Thursday night to put the good of the nation over political benefit and pass a huge jobs plan he proposed.In a speech to a joint session of Congress, Obama told the legislators to stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy by quickly approving the $447 billion package of measures so he can sign it into law.The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities. The question tonight is whether we'll meet ours, Obama said to applause. The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy. The question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.Obama also told legislators that they should quickly pass his plan, called the American Jobs Act.There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation, the president said. Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight. And everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything.Obama said he will ask Congress to increase the $1.5 trillion target in deficit reduction being pursued by a special joint congressional committee to cover the cost of the American Jobs Act. He said he will propose his own deficit-reduction plan on September 19 that would reform entitlement programs such as Medicare while changing the tax system to end loopholes, lower the corporate tax rate and increase taxes for the wealthy.In essence, Obama resurrected his push for a so-called grand bargain -- a comprehensive deficit reduction package that includes all the drivers of government spending and deficits, including those traditionally favored and protected by both parties.Republican reaction ranged from an expressed interest in trying to work out compromise to outright rejection and criticism of what was labeled a repeat of failed policies from the past.House Speaker John Boehner, who backed out of talks with Obama on a major deficit reduction-deal deal earlier this year, said the proposals the president outlined merit consideration, and added that he hoped for serious consideration by the White House of Republican ideas.It's my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses, and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation, said Boehner, R-Ohio.Conservative Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was much more critical.President Obama, perhaps not knowing what else to do, is simply calling for more of the same, as if giving us more of the failed policies of the last two-and-a-half years will somehow yield different results, Kyl said in a statement. I believe President Obama's new 'stimulus' will further delay economic recovery and continue to inflict harm on so many Americans.The Senate's top Democrat, meanwhile, said Obama's proposal will present a litmus test for Republicans.I hope they (Republicans) will show the American people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said in a statement. Experts from the ratings agencies to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have said that political gridlock is the main obstacle standing in the way of our economic growth. It is time to put jobs and the economy ahead of partisan politics.\\\\That point resonated with veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who joked on CNN that the president's poll numbers were very bad, but have you seen Congress' numbers?We seek approval, too, McCain said.According to Obama, the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term unemployed, Obama said. It will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will be customers for their products and services. You should pass this jobs plan right away.He also told Republicans he would take his case directly to the American people, and called on every American who agrees to lift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now.Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option, Obama said.White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN that Obama will send Congress jobs plan legislation next week.Obama's plan comes as unemployment remains lodged at 9.1% with no new jobs reported in August, raising fears of a possible return to recession. With 14 months to go until the presidential election, he wants the plan -- as well as the speech to Congress to present it -- to clearly illustrate to the American public the ideological differences between his policies and those of the Republican right.The mood in the House chamber was jovial before the speech, with Vice President Joe Biden playfully hugging Speaker John Boehner when he arrived at the dais. Democratic legislators repeatedly applauded during the address.House Republican and White House sources told CNN that Obama called Boehner and McConnell on Thursday afternoon to preview the speech. Even so, a legislative struggle is certain. Republicans call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth, opposing what they label new stimulus spending.The Democratic leader in the Republican-controlled House -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California -- asked the ranking Democrats on committees that will consider the legislation proposed by Obama to urge their Republican chairmen to schedule immediate hearings and legislative action on the measures.Boehner, meanwhile, invited 12 business leaders -- dubbed job creators in his statement -- who have been affected by regulations enacted by the administration to attend the speech.These are people with real world experience on how the regulations coming out of this administration are impeding their ability to grow their business and create jobs, Boehner's statement said.At least five Republicans -- two senators and three House members -- didn't plan to attend the speech, which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said was more of a political event than a policy statement.By all accounts, the president's so-called jobs plan is to try those very same policies again and then accuse anyone who doesn't support them this time around of being political and overly partisan, of not doing what's needed in this moment of crisis, McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Thursday morning. This isn't a jobs plan. It is a re-election plan.Anticipating such criticism, Obama said he was proposing needed and logical measures that traditionally receive broad support.This isn't political grandstanding. This isn't class warfare. This is simple math, he said. These are real choices that we have to make. And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close. And it's time for us to do what's right for our future.Obama said his plan would increase the current payroll tax cut to put additional money in the pockets of Americans at a cost of $175 billion. The current cut, which has cost $112 billion so far, allows employees to pay 4.2% instead of 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security.Obama's proposal included extended unemployment benefits, which were lengthened to the current 99-week maximum in 2009. Top Democrats argue that such money will immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending.In addition, the plan proposes $60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges, including establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects.Other provisions in the president's proposal include money to refurbish schools and provide state aid for teachers and first responders, and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long-term unemployed and military veterans.Looking abroad, the president also renewed his push for congressional approval of stalled free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. The measures, despite the congressional roadblock, have relatively broad bipartisan support.The president took aim at tea party conservatives who call for deep spending cuts to shrink government instead of the comprehensive approach he advocates.In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own -- that's not who we are, Obama said.He repeatedly urged the legislators to pass this jobs bill, using a rhetorical flourish that regularly prompted cheers and applause form Democrats.No single individual built America on their own, Obama said. We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.CNN's Alan Silverleib, Charles Riley, Jessica Yellin, Brianna Keilar, Tom Cohen and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- Nostalgia and flimsy evidence led to guilty verdicts in the nation's oldest cold case ever solved, according to the man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and murdering a neighbor's child in 1957.In his 80-page appeal, former police officer Jack Daniel McCullough says he deserves a new trial because his mother was allowed to accuse him from the grave -- while he was kept from proving that he was elsewhere when a 7-year-old girl was abducted and killed.The appellate brief, filed Thursday by the Illinois state appellate defender, noted that nobody saw who grabbed Maria Ridulph from a street corner in Sycamore, Illinois, or witnessed how or where she was killed.No forensic evidence ties McCullough -- or anyone else -- to a crime so shocking it captured the attention of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the appeal states.Instead, the court papers say, prosecutors built their case on unreliable evidence, including inmate witnesses whose motives were suspect and others whose memories were dulled by the passage of time:The evidence against Jack McCullough, the appeal contended, was so unreasonable, so improbable, and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder, kidnapping, and abduction of an infant.That evidence included personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident; testimony from jailhouse informants; innocuous statements from the defendant; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant's mother while on morphine and Haldol just before her death.The appeal cited many of the issues raised by legal experts who spoke with CNN for Taken: The coldest case ever solved, a five-part multimedia series published in August. The series was the basis for an hour-long documentary that aired on HLN.Read the appeal (PDF)McCullough was convicted in September 2012 of kidnapping and murdering Maria Ridulph 55 years earlier. The brown-eyed second-grader vanished from the corner of Sycamore's Archie Place and Center Cross Street on the evening of December 3, 1957.Her body was found the following spring in a grove of trees off a busy state highway about 120 miles away. The crime, which shook the small farming community to its core, is believed to be the country's oldest cold case ever prosecuted.Now 74, McCullough is serving a life sentence at a state prison in Pontiac, Illinois.He denied committing the crime in several letters to CNN and in a jailhouse interview last year. He also denied having anything to do with Maria's disappearance and death in a lengthy police interrogation in Seattle hours before his arrest. Prosecutors and investigators said his odd demeanor during questioning convinced them they had the right man.The DeKalb County State's Attorney, which prosecuted McCullough, declined comment and referred calls to the Illinois state appellate prosecutor, which also declined to comment on a pending case. A court clerk said both sides should finish filing their briefs by late June and arguments could be scheduled by summer.I think the problem with Jack's trial is, it was all emotion-based, said Janey O'Connor, McCullough's stepdaughter and most outspoken defender. She said she hopes his lawyers can convince the appeals court to view the case with a more objective eye.To find a man guilty based on conflicting stories, unconstitutional rulings and emotion and not allow Jack the chance to present the evidence that cleared his name in 1957 goes against our constitutional rights, she said.Testimony lasted little more than a week at McCullough's trial, which was decided by a judge brought in from a neighboring county.For the most part, the appeal focused on Judge James Hallock's pretrial rulings regarding what evidence to allow and what evidence to exclude.Hallock used an exception to the hearsay rule to let McCullough's sisters testify about a deathbed statement by their mother but excluded as hearsay police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation. He also excluded a Sycamore police detective's investigation during the mid-1990s that concluded that another man, now deceased, committed the crime.In a court with murder charges at issue, the law demands more than nostalgia, state appellate defender Paul Glaser wrote. It demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Glaser did not represent McCullough at his trial; he was appointed by the state to handle his appeal.The appeal noted that prosecutors took great effort to describe the gentle, small-town nature of Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957. It was a time and place where the abduction and murder of a child playing in the season's first snow was a shocking, defining and tragic event, the appeal said, but criminal responsibility for kidnapping, child abduction and murder needed to be proven to competent evidence.In this case, the appeal stated, the evidence presented against McCullough woefully failed to rise to the level of proof necessary to sustain his conviction. The appeal criticized Hallock's rulings as a gross abuse of discretion that prevented McCullough from receiving a fair trial.Hallock declined to comment on the case, citing Illinois' code of judicial conduct.McCullough's appellate lawyers focused their attack on a hospital bed accusation by his sedated, dying mother that prompted Illinois State Police to reopen their investigation. The defense has long argued that it should never have been disclosed in court.McCullough's sisters testified that their mother told them John did it or he did it but gave contradicting testimony on what she meant by it.Eileen Tessier, who was in the end stages of cancer, was sedated, emotionally disturbed, sometimes basically comatose and at other times pleasantly confused, the testimony showed.Prosecutors persuaded Hallock to allow the statement under a hearsay exception, arguing that Tessier could have faced obstruction of justice charges herself for covering up for her son all those years. But the appellate lawyers countered that criminal charges weren't a realistic possibility for a terminally ill woman.Instead the statement was an out-of-court accusation, the appeal stated, the admission of which should have been strictly forbidden.Kathy Sigman Chapman was the prosecution's star witness and the last person to see Maria alive, besides the killer. Chapman, who was 8 at the time her friend vanished, was shown hundreds if not thousands of photographs as a child but didn't identify the stranger who called himself Johnny until 53 years after the crime.She was in her 60s and living in a neighboring city when an Illinois State Police detective knocked on her door and showed her a group of photographs. She picked one she had not seen before -- a recropped prom photo showing 17-year-old John Tessier, as McCullough was then known -- and identified him as the young man who gave Maria a piggyback ride minutes before she vanished.She also identified the photograph in court, but the appeal asserts that the appearance of the man in the photo differs from the description she gave in court of the man she saw on the street corner.Three jailhouse informants testified about conversations they said they had with McCullough while he was awaiting trial. They gave varying accounts of how he described killing her: with a wire, strangling her with his hands or dropping her on her head.The informants and several police detectives from Seattle, where McCullough was initially questioned and arrested, also testified about odd statements he made about Maria Ridulph. They said he described her as lovely, with big brown eyes and like a little Barbie doll. While the appeal referred to those statements and vivid descriptions of a little girl he knew 50 years ago as innocuous, others have described them as unsettling, even creepy.Given the circumstantial nature of the prosecution's case, the appeal asserted, the defense should have been able to expect some leeway. But, court papers say, the judge's pretrial rulings prevented McCullough from presenting his defense. He was unable to call a witness, former Sycamore police detective Patrick Solar, who concluded during the mid-1990s that another man committed the crime.And he was not permitted to present police and FBI reports from the 1957 kidnapping investigation that indicated he was questioned and cleared from the list of suspects because he had an alibi.The reports indicated that McCullough spoke with military recruiters in Rockford, about 40 miles away, about the time Maria was taken from the street corner in Sycamore. They also seemed to verify his story that he made a collect call home, asking for a ride. Phone records at the time, long since lost, indicated that a collect call was placed from a pay phone in Rockford to the Tessier family home in Sycamore at 6:57 p.m. by someone giving his name as John Tassier. The call lasted two minutes.Illinois law does not allow police reports and other documents as a substitute for witness testimony at trials. But in this case, almost all of the FBI agents and police investigators had died, and McCullough's defense sought to introduce the reports as ancient documents or public records more than 20 years old. Hallock, the trial judge, rejected that argument.The judge's decisions to prohibit Jack McCullough from introducing FBI records prepared at the time of the offense, despite their status as ancient documents and public records and their probative value in establishing Mr. McCullough's alibi, and to prohibit Mr. McCullough from presenting testimony showing another man committed the offense, amounted to gross abuses of discretion denying Mr. McCullough his fundamental right to present a defense, the appeal stated.By blocking the defense while allowing prosecutors to introduce irrelevant, but highly prejudicial evidence, the judge violated McCullough's right to a fair trial, the appeal stated, before delivering a final salvo: No rational trier of fact would have found the defendant guilty.Police get break in missing girls' cold case from 1975Arrest in 40-year-old murder caseFour decades later, disappearance of 2 missing girls blamed on wreck\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 82,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"50 years since legendary Arnold Palmer claimed his third U.S. Masters triumph. 1962 statistically his greatest year with victory at British Open and six other tournaments.
